5978	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The features of the setting that affect the cyclist is the lact of information on were to go and the lack of water. This was a problem because he needed water for his trip and directions on were to go.  	1	1		1																					
5979	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way. He was in the desert, which is dry and hot. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). Also, the  temperature was hot and made every thing around him hot, “brackish water faling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Since he was in the desert, there was no escape from the sun. The text  states, “The sun was beginning to beat down”(Kurmaskie @NUM3). The cyclist was all alone in the road with none around him either so into he passed out, no one could help him. “ and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgous day in June”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). ""About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town’ but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town."" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). Thesettings that the cyclist was riding in wasn't good ones and so they negativly affected him; causing him to be dehydrated and tiredin the end."	2	2		2																					
5980	3	"Everyone travels to unfamiliar places. Sometimes we get lost and ask locals for directions which @MONTH1 not be a good idea. The setting affected the cyclist. He had a perfectly good map but asked older men who look like they haven’t been out in ages. The old men apparently haven’t been out because they gave the cyclist the wrong directions.  My advice would be to not listen to anyone no matter their age if you have a perfectly good map with you. Also try to know where you are going at all times. “Yes, sir!"	1	1		1																					
5981	3	"I believe the features of the cyclist affected him because he was impatient and trustworthy he tock the old mens advice to take an hr of his time bay taking a short cat, if he would of stayed true to the mep he wouldn’t of almost ared of heat but his impatientress got the best of him so he took the shortcut.

When he reaches the first “town” he sees “One ramshackle sheds several rusty pumps and a coral that couldnt hold the lamesh mule.” If the setting had the problem of no water so there would be no conflict in the story, “In the story the speeker says “I was travling through the high deserts of California” that are very hot and dry, and he says “This causes the problem of it being hot and dry if the seting was a forest in @DATE1 he wouldn’t have as much of a problem needing water which would of made the story much less exciting."	2	2		2

I’m one of them people who does not care about it cause it does not affect me or anyone I know. It is a big deal to write people, some of them @CAPS1 blow stuff up.

5986	3	"The essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” describes a man’s bicycle ride through California. Now, California is very hot during the summer, which is when the cyclist is riding. This setting greatly affects the man’s journey. It made it very difficult for him to finish his ride. He drank most of his water in the beginning of his ride so he gets very dehydrated. The text states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” As you can see the setting makes this man’s bikeride very hard."	2	2		2																					
5987	3	"In the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” written by Joe Kurmaskie, represents how certain conditions can affect a cyclist. The cyclist was biking through the desert to reach Yosemite National Park, but on his journey he accoutered many tough conditions to make it difficult to get there. First of all, the desert was very hot which makes travel very difficult. For example the text states, “the sun was beginning to beat down.” @CAPS1 makes any task difficult because the sun drain’s a person’s energy. Secondly, the trip was very long so the cyclist had a hard time conserving water. For instance, the man drank so much water, he almost ran out; “The water bottle contained only dehydration which can cause death. Joe Kurmaskie’s story, “Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” represents how certain conditions of an environment can affect a cyclist.  "	2	3		3																					
5988	3	"The setting of the authors “ shortcut” effected his performance and strength tremendously . whether it was the hills, heat or barren landscape all three took their toll on Joe Kurmaskie. Not only that, but his lack of water depleted his energy as well.” Flat road was repalced by short rolling hills.” The hills were a tough thing to pass since Joe was being drained of energy. He overcame this exhaustion when a building came into views.” I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited with what I believed was my last burst of energy. I manouvered down the hill.” The authour overcame all the problems ne faced even though it was difficult. He seems to have written this piece to exaggrate how important it is to keep going when you want to give up. Winston churchill once said, “ success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage it takes to continues that counts.” I believe that @PERSON2 agrees."	3	2		3																					
5989	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist very much so! The cyclist is riding through the hot desert. Meaning he needs lots of cold water to keep him hydrated. The longer he rides in the hot sun, the more he sweats, the more likely he will get dehydrated. If he was riding in the rain or snow it could possibly slow him down also, because he would be cold and his muscles might get stiff and not be able to move as fast. This is why the setting affects the cyclist very much so. "	1	1		1																					
5990	3	"There was many features that affected the cyclist such as heat and lack of water. The cyclist was drinking a lot of water throughout the story and ends up only having little water left. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” That shows he wasn’t prepared with enough water for his trip to Yosemite. Without water he/she would die from the heat. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke"" This states that he @CAPS1 the danger of not having enough water in his system.

Furthermore, the desert and nothing around gave the cyclist of abandoness and no help for when he is I trouble. Finally, the cyclist is greatly relieved when he sees the bait store and that people are there. The features in the setting greatly affected the cyclist on his ride."	1	2		2

5993	3	"In the essay Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the author Joe Kurmaskie uses the features of the setting to affect the cyclist. The cyclist is affected by these features because of he sees the same setting (the dessert) for several miles, he has no water and, the road has a lot of hills. The cyclist could been affected by seeing the dessert and no scenary changes for a wahile. When you look at one same scene for hours you could start to get tired and bored with everything. So this cause him to be very drossy and bored. Also the cyclist had no water as none of the fountains were cold water.

Also the time of your in which this labes place, greatly affects the cyclist. Lastly, the type of road and amount of ground that he has to cover after affects his performance. Overall, setting can be a determining factor in a journey as they life"	2	2		2																					
5995	3	"The setting of the story affects the cyclist in many ways. Since he is riding in the California desert, he always feels very hot and is always in constant thirst. In addition to this the area he is riding in appears to be quite desolate. He finds nothing but old abondored buildings. He doesn't find anyone. No people or cars, or any sign of modern civilization. This causes him to feel a little unnerved as if something happened to him nobody would know about it. This is especially prevelent when he become dehydrated. In those ways, the cyclist is very much affected by the setting."	2	2		2																					
5996	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by @PERSON1, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way the setting affects the cyclist is, in the desert, the cyclist drank more water than before. For example, the text states “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. You will drink more water in a desert than in a forest. If you go cycling, be aware of the settings around you because they will affect you."	1	1		1																					
5997	3	"Some features of the setting affect the cyclist. First the cyclist followed the old codgers advice of how to get to Yosemite National Park. Their advice was no use and didnt help her in the end. Next, “a tarlike substance oozed out” of what she thoot was going to be water. Then the terrain changed to “short, rolling hills”, which wasnt helping, her bike better. Lastly, ""tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake”, slowed her down. All of these road blocks in the setting affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
5998	3	"The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the lack of water, out of date information, and rolling hills. If he had up to date information then he would probably have got water from a town that’s not empty or almost empty like a “ghost town” as the cyclist said."	2	1		2																					
5999	3	The cyclist has a couple things if he racing and the wind is blowing then theres a problem and he has to follow traffic law and ride on the right side or the road.	0	1		1																					
6000	3	"“Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” had a  rough setting between harzardous things and the death defying heat. The cyclist had to endure the pain of dehydration and determination. He had been given bad directions that almost caused him his life. He was travelling through a desert and claimed the temperature was @NUM1.Also, the cyclist had to ration his water because it was ghost towns in which our character passed through. He used nature skills he’d once learned and began to suck on pebbles which take the mind off thirst and uses saliva to help refresh your throat. Throughout his adventure everything kept this young man from getting water and to whenever there was water any faster. He had survived and wouldn’t ever take shortcuts again"	2	2		2																					
6001	3	An example of the setting affecting the cyclist is when he has the lock of water in a ghost town in just eliterat. He frind the water but e tar like substance come out and it tasted like battery. When he left he had to go through rough road which he couldn’t travel that fast leanes of the condition of the road.	1	1		1																					
6002	3	"The cyclist had a very hard time geting to Yosemite National Park. This is because the sun was out, and it was in the middle of June. I was so hot out the cyclist became dehydrated faster than he would have on a cooler day. When the pumped the handle of the old rusted water pump, he said the water felt, “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. The cyclist also had to deal with a lot of ""short rolling hills"", which was much more difficult to bike on than flat roads. On top of everything else the roads were in very bad condition, so you had to watch for rocks in the road."	2	2		2																					
6003	3	"The cyclist in the story is at first confident in accepting the old men’s help, and doesn’t seem to suspect anything is wrong when he first starts out. The way the men directed him seem all going for his water supply is all in store, and the first land mark, a ghost town now, is exactly where it is supposed to be. The next “town” he hits doesn’t have anything that could replenish his diminishing water supply and he starts to feel troubled. However he was told the next town wasn’t further, so he pressed on. Then the scenery makes a drastic change, the flat roads becoming hills, the sun beating hotter- it really look like a desert after tumbleweeds even go past! The cyclist continues on, despite being very dehydrated. The next thing to come along is an old juice building that almost seems to mark him on how he has no water. He keeps on, however, and at last sees a shop where he can get water. The canging scenery sends the cyclist from confidence to worry, to hopelessness and lastly, relief."	3	3		3																					
6004	3	Well I would put it like this is that the weather had everything to do with it because the not weather make you tired and upset and easy to angre so now it make you upset and and then stress.	1	1		1																					
6005	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in two way. This ways are pysical and mental. The pysical ways that features affect cyclist is the terrain. If the roads are long and wiredy, this could wear the cyclist out. They could also become physically tired if the incline of the hill is to steep. When it’s you against gravity, it can be egausting. The temperature can also be a crusal factor in a cyclist pysical ability. Nobody want to feel like their in a sauna when they are bike riding. The cyclist and also be attracted mentally. If the terrain looks deserted or anything like a desert the byciclist instintaniously thinks “dehydration” and “death.” If some people see dead animals or bones they would think they could die. If they see vulture circling them they would get afraid and think death, but the worse thing of all is that knowing all of these things are in the same place at the same time. This is how setting affects cyclists"	3	2		3																					
6006	3	"The settings of the story were grveling. While the cyclist was riding along, the sun was beginning to beat down on him. The cyclist began to sweat due to the heat and thus he drank just about all of his water. Now the cyclist was experiencing major heat, sweat, and dehydration. The California desert is a grveling place to be, especially in June. Luckily, the cyclist did come up to a camp and found fresh food and water, before he would eventually continue his way to Yosemite National Park"	2	2		2																					
6007	3	"As the cyclist is travelling to Yosemite National Park, he comes across many features in the area that affects him. First, he takes directions from some old guys who don’t know anything about the changes in maps because they never leave their porch. At first, it affects him in a positive way, because he thought he had a good shortcut to Yosemite. However, the affect later came negative because it turned out to be a shortcut that never existed. Another feature that affected him wasted the setting which was a desert-like area. The heat made it harder for him to ride his bike, and he also drank a lot of his water. This later resulted in him becoming dehydrated. A positive affect was when he found the bait shop, where he rehydrated himself and got some new directions."	2	3		3																					
6008	3	"The features of this setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting is a dessert so by common knowledge you know that it is going to be hot and dry. Because it is hot the cyclist needs more water because he is getting dehydrated. And when he is on his low of water because it is dry into mouth gets drys. @CAPS2 because he is in the dessert he sees wild sometime dangerous animals, in the story he sees a ridiculously @CAPS1 diamondbrock snake, which I believe are venomous, @CAPS2 ‘because ‘ of the extreme heat of the dessert he realizes that he had ??? chance of dropping from heatstroke. @CAPS2 the writer said that the dessert had short rolling hills and rough road ahead ??? would leave worn the cyclist out. Because of this terrain the cyclist way affects."	1	1		1																					
6010	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One example is the hot sun that was beating down on him made him very thirsty. Another feature is the rough road that wore the cyclist out and made him tired. My last example is the old juice factory with the picture of a refreshing cup of juice on it made the cyclist feel like giving up because he thought he would die of dehydration. These are my reasons as to why the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways.   	1	1		1

6012	3	"Understanding, realitic, mode-all are reason’s how setting affects the setting. If a book has a good setting then the book might be pretty good. When you have a setting it’s more understable of what they are trying today. And if you have a good setting it makes it more realitic So when you read it you wont be thrown off, the mode of the story sets it all off, because usually books have there ups and downs. That’s why they chase the mode.  "	0	0		0																					
6013	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist by making him dehydrated which could lead to a heatstroke. “I could drop from a heatstroke” this shows that it was hot out and he was feeling bad if he could have dropped from a heatstroke.	1	1		1																					
6014	3	"The terrain during the cyclist’s journey greatly affects him. For example, the first terrain that he experienced was not very hilly, but rather flat and soothing. The author stated, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” This shows that he was energized and happy. However, the reader can predict that the journey will not remain this joyful, because the cyclist is basically in the desert during the summer, in which it is extremely hot. Then, the cyclist experiences hilly terrain that sucked the life from his body, especially because he had no water left. The cyclist said, “sometimes life can feel so cruel"", emphasizing that the cyclist mood had changed from enthusiastic to tired and forlorn.  This change of mood from the terrain can be connected to real life, as obstacles are include, in which the person must persevere and be strong to overcome, in which the cyclist finally did. "	3	2		3																					
6015	3	"The features in the story great effect the cyclist. One feature of the setting that effects the cyclist is the heat. At first, the story says that the pine trees cooled the cyclist, but eventually the forest turned into a desert, and the heat poured down on him, make it hard to cycle. Another feature that effected the cyclist was the lack of water. As he moved away from his beginning point, the cyclist was drinking lots of water. But when he needed to refill, the water was brown and hot, so the cyclist didn’t take any. The lack of water plus the heat formed one giant obstacle that potentialy could have killed him, but through great determination the cyclist got through this troubling time."	2	2		2																					
6016	3	"The narrator in this story goes through a tough journey insisting of hope, challenge physical pain, despair, and relief. All of these are further developed by the settings where they take place, For example after taking advice from old men at a campsite, he is on his way through the deserts of California. If he had been almost anywhere else, his journey could have been much better. He could have gotten more reliable advice, or had been in a place where the towns were not miles and miles apart. Also, at one point he reaches a snake on the road. This could symbolize a decision, which was to go and how it will affect the outcome of his trip, or perhaps the decisions he had already made. To take advice from strangers and better yet he should use it. The irony continues as he becomes dehydrated and the flat land turns hilly. If that weren’t to happen he could have been more successful and healthy on his trip. The setting in this men’s story are necessary for if to have plot line and have the humour it possesses. If he were in the city, for example, he would not get lost and stranded, and therefore would have no story."	3	2		3																					
6017	3	The setting in the story changes many times. It starts in an area with rivers and pine trees. Then the cyclist arrives ant a town. After that he is pounded by the hot sun and along hilly road. With not much water left the cyclist uses all the energy he had to get to a town where he could get something to drink. The setting was what made the cyclists journey a hard one.	1	1		1																					
6018	3	The features of the settings affect in the story “Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit” it is the morning and everyone is still sleep and he wakes in the morning for something to do when he pull up to the first plase he thinks that they are all old and crazy and he thinking that the places needs fixing because the houses are falling apart. Then..leaves and see these wide bunch of hills. inconclusion I would never do all the riding he did.  	1	2		2																					
6019	3	The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the desert with no water and doesnt know where he is going. The old men on the porch gave him wrong directions now he is lost in the desert. The cyclist find the will power to keep on moving and he finds help along the way. He finds another old man there that offer him directions but he says he has a map	1	1		1																					
6020	3	"The setting in the story discouraged the biker very much. As he follows the advice of the elderly men and starts off his journey he notices that there is, “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” He uses tone words to describe how had things are when he says, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He describes in exhaust how hard his journey is getting. He describes the intense heat inthe desert of California, pedaling up, “ one long, crippling hill.” The terrain did not make his rideeasy at all. The factor of weather, rolling hills, and the shortage of water take a tall on him. If he were on flat terrain on a cool day then he would have been first fine."	2	2		2																					
6021	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist alot. The hot sun beating down on him makes him sweat and makes him thirsty. The bumpy roods and hills make him work harder. The abandoned places make him lose hope. If faced with these obstacles I would have been affected in the same way. As I believe any human would be.	1	2		2																					
6022	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist.The features of the setting, or nature, affect the cyclist because they are wearing her out. The cyclist is going to the city of of yosemite but some guys gave her a short cut. Through this shortcut are hills and heat and lack of water. @CAPS1 describes this by saying, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited.” @CAPS1 is excited that there is a building that @CAPS1 might get some water from. Also, @CAPS1 wiped the sweat from her eyes meaning it is hot outside and @CAPS1 is sweating and losing water. Therefore, the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6023	3	"The three most important features of the setting that effect the cyclist are the ground he is traveling, the towns he passes, and the availability of water. The ground the cyclist is riding over is important because the rougher the terrain, and the more hills there are, the more energy he must use, and the less distance he can travel. @PERSON1 is riding fine until he must travel the rolling hills which consume his energy, ehausts his water, and causes dividing hope. As he approaches towns, his hope increases but soon fades due to the realization that the town will be unable of giving him relief. When he pumps out water that tastes like “battery acid,” his hope once again diminishes. As he sees the bait and tackle shop, he knows he can make it there and that when he gets there he can recover. These three features are what effects the cyclist the most."	2	2		2																					
6024	3	"In the story of “rough road ahead :do not exceed posted limit” the setting affected the cyclist. In the middle of the desert during the summer the cyclist was low on water.

6025	3	Some of the features of the setting affect the cyclist like the road was bad it had bumps all over that made it much harder and it also took up a lot of strength. Also the neighborhood of two hundre degrees after that become to a road with arore bunch of hills	1	1		1																					
6026	3	"In the story many different settings affected the author in many different ways. In the very beginning of his journey he came across a ghost town. He reacted to the features of this setting with humor and hope. “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" He still has hope that he would end up safe and in the right place. The next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the rode. He grew worried when he saw that no near town was still in sight. “This sight was troubling” when the features of the next setting caught his eye he was desperate and devastated. “At some point, tumble weed crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” He was on rough terrain in the middle of the desert with little water, when he reached the abandoned @CAPS1’s factory all his hope was lost and when he was planning his death. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" @CAPS2, when he reached the fish camp, he was relieved ""I had overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, Kiss them and buy some bait.” He was overjoyed and overwhelmed because he had survived.    "	3	3		3																					
6027	3	"Ghost towns are not exactly the most inviting place for a cyclis trunning low on water supply. In “Rough road ahead: do not exceed speed limit” the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings. Starting off on a warm day with the sun bright start off as a good thing, while his mood is still fresh and happy expressions play on his face. But as he moves on he speaks of how “The sun was beginning to beat down” expressing his remorse of listening to the old men that led him on their “shortcut.” Along the road he comes to his first let-down, a ghost town with “one ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest male.” @CAPS1 he tries to pump the water from the corral but gets a “battery-acid” flavor and is forced to continue onward with little left to drink. This affects his mood to pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament. By the end he is relieved though when he comes to GARY & @CAPS2 FISH CAMP, a place with a working sink full of cold water. He says he “had an overwhelming urge to seek out @ORGANIZATION1, kiss them and buy some bait.” His thankfulness is expressed to men he doesn’t even know but because they were the light at the end of his long, dark and very exhausting tunnel."	3	3		3																					
6028	3	"The features of setting affect the cyclist. It was hard arrived at the first town for author. For example “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The road that author was ridding, it was rough. @CAPS1 example is “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” All the road was hills and rough. Than “The water bottle contained only a few tontalizing sips.” @CAPS1 doesn’t have that much water. That was really hard."	2	1		2																					
6029	3	"The features of the selling effect the cyclist a lot. One factor that would effect the cyclist would be the heat. Also, because of this factor, he’s pobably suffering from lack of water. He’s probably really hot seeing he’s the only one cut in the middle of nowhere for what looks like miles. Another feature of the setting that would probably effect the cyclist is the thought of there @MONTH1 be a car around this next turn. If he can’t see around the next turn he doesn’t know is coming. The cyclist could also be thinking about when the next town will show up."	1	1		1																					
6030	3	"The setting puts a great deal of stress on the cyclist. The biggest issue he faces is the weather. He is a cyclist “traveling through the high deserts of @LOCATION1 in June.” He had been riding his bike all day and he was soon going to run out of water. Just when he thought he could drink more water, he drank “water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” The weather being so hot and humid, did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” is a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder therefore use more energy. Luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground, helped keep his mind off the thirst. There were many factors of the setting that negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure."	3	2		3

The changes in his environment directly affect the completion of his journey and his health. As the narrator makes his way to Yosemite national park from the none of the old men his first encounter with his environment acknowledges his deserve and need for water. The text states “I had been huting my water pretty regularly... the high deserts of California in June”. To disappointed the truck stop’s water supply from the pumps was not adequate for his concumption, only forcing him to link elsewhere to quench his thirst next, he explenced rolling hills by exsercising more energy he made his way now everyone still in need of water.

6032	3	"The setting affected the cyclist a lot. One way was the heat. It got so hot that he was becoming dehydrated. He kept drinking his water, until he didnt have any left. Another reason is because the road turned into hills which made him use more energy. Finally, it didn't help that he hadnt seen any sign of living creatures except for a snake @CAPS1 how the setting affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6033	3	"The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the main character the cyclist. The cyclist is biking “through the high desert of california in June.” So naturally it can be infereal that it is not and dry, making water a delicacy. As the cyclist is passing through a ghost town and a pump that releases “a tarlike substance followed by brackish water” he is runningout of his precious water. The surrounding landscape of lonely hills tumbleweeds and snakes does not inspire confidence. In fact, the cyclist feels that “l cald drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” He finds an old Grape Juice Factory no longer in service causing more anxiousness and dispare l have had an experience similar to this where l wat out walking in a state park in the @DATE1. I was freezing, and a desolate landscape of snow covered trees made me feel at if I’d never be warm again similar to He cyclist who’s environment made him feel hes wald die of dehydration. So, as can be seen. He setting of this short story affects the cyclist.   "	3	3		3																					
6034	3	"The settings that affected the cyclist were in fact ones you don’t want to be near when you are out of water and tired from pedaling. The time and place affected him greatly because there wasn’t a cool breeze in the air in June at California. He was in the middle of flat deserts and had no sense of where the part as and where civilization too so he can get some water. The quote “old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” helped you realize taking advice of direction from old people who don’t go anywhere is a bad idea. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills”. This quote shows you some terrail features that affected the cyclist. Furthermore, the cyclist realivingly found civilization with running water."	2	2		2																					
6035	3	"In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit""  the author Joe Kurmaskie tells you that there many things you have to go through before you get there. The example is when ""he stops and asks for directions to Yosemite state park"". Because he did what to get lost. When he had to and other towns. The next example is when he came to a rock in the road:  And had to get water form a old rusted pump because he had really no water left in his water bottle"	1	1		1																					
6036	3	"I think the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the terrain “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills” this shows that he is a warm and trobled by the change of the terrain. He also fells alone “I toiled on at some point tumbleweed crossed my path” he also. Though he was in a ghost town. “Summer time” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my detorating brain"" he felt that he was slowly dying. He also though he was losing it, the sun had a great impact on him because he wiped his face to make sure he was no seeing a mirage. But through it all he had hopes the author also wants us to have hope and keep on going even though things dont look good keep moving foward never look back and alway's be positive and take advanage of your surrounding. This is the message the author tries to give"	2	2		2																					
6037	3	"Heat, dry, flat - all are features of the setting that effected the cyclist. As the cyclist was driving through the desert, he noticed how hot it was, and how he would become dehydrated quickley. I was also very dry and and he started to get nervous about how thirsty he was. The flat ground models how there is nothing around that can help the cyclist, which made him scared. The story also metions that he is a ghost town"	2	2		2

6039	3	"In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie there were many things that effected the cyclist. Such as the water. He had no really good water to drink because of where he was''. When I tryed a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid''. He wasnt able to drink the water because the battery acid'' that was in it could have made him very sick. Also the unstable roads that he had to bike through made things hard. ''Rough roads ahead'' To ride on unstable ground can be very hard to do. So just these two examples, the water and Rough roads made the features of the setting deffinitly effect the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6040	3	In the essay ‘ Rough Road Ahead Do Not exede posted speed him if many of the featutres of the setting affect the cyclist. At first the cyclist goes by river wich he wount find later in the journey.As he goes along in the journey the heat and lack of water starts to affect him. Also he finds a water fountain that pours hot water with the flavor that has long since been shut down. The cyclist is affected by many features of the setting.	1	1		1																					
6041	3	The feature of setting affects the cyclist because the roads are too rough. If he gos too pot he could spin out of commission and the water was trouble. He sad “when I tried a deep or two it had the flavor of a battery acid.	2	1		2																					
6042	3	"The cyclist is mostly affected by his lack of water. In the beginning of his ride the cyclist is confident and is striving to reach the joys of @LOCATION1. He longs for, “the cool pines and rushing rivers…” (@NUM1). Later on when the cyclist reaches the rough terrain, he starts feeling exhaustion as he depletes his water supply. A bit of relief later comes upon him after a long climb over a hill until he sees a shut down juice factory almost seeming like it was put there to tease him. His destination fills him with relief and pride, knowing that he would survive the strenuous journey."	2	2		2																					
6043	3	"The setting effected the cyclist in a great way. The snakes blocked his pathways, and hi short water supply made it hard to continue. He felt as if he could drop of a heatstroke. His environment, and the information from the old man made his ride very hard to continue. All in all, his settings had a big effect on him."	1	1		1																					
6044	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the rode conditions. The rode was all messed up. 	1	2		2																					
6045	3	"The cyclist was well prepaired for his adventure however hot enuff for a change in senary. When the old men told him to take a difficult path and did his in tire setting changed for the worst. After this he was nearly over powered by devastating hills and dehydration was slowly creeping up on him as well. He had not nearly packed enuff water or supplies for a change such as that and he would regret it later. The Hills were steep and endless, and the sun was hot and mercilous mankind it even worse on him. This is how the change of setting affected the cyclist.  "	2	2		2																					
6046	3	"Setting can affect anyone and everyone, in this case it happened to be a cyclist. Since it was June, it happened to be pretty not outside causing the cyclist to lose more body fluid due to his constant movement producing sweat. This makes water a must have. Also, as he passes through, he comes across a sign that read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED @CAPS1. Since the road was harder to drive on, riding a bike across it isn’t much easier. Anothe way the setting affected the cyclist was the snake that blocked the road, which he thought of to be a diamondback."	1	1		1																					
6047	3	"The features of setting  really effects the cyclist because of the condition. For example, the weather, it is hot, it will slow the person down. And if it’s perfect that will let the person go at regular speed. And the roads, if the road is bumpy that will slow them down. And if its smooth that will speed them up. See, it really does depend on the condition."	1	1		1																					
6048	3	"The setting affects the  author alot. First he is in a California desert in the middle of June. It is very hot out. This makes the cyclist very tired. There are some cool pines, but they do help much. There is also no where to get water for a very long time. The narration states, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). With no water the cyclist was dehydrated. This hurt his biking skills like balance and led stregth. Finally there was no one around for most of the story. The cyclist did not know how far he had to go until he reached @CAPS1 or water. There was also no one  to help him if he were to have a heat stroke."	1	1		1																					
6049	3	"In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist traveled miles on a bike dealing with the weather in the deserts, little bit of water, and being tired. The cyclist faced many hard times trying to travel on a bicycle from one point to another."	1	1		1																					
6050	3	"The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclist’s attitude and adversities. The path of the cyclist is through California deserts, which are dry and hot. This first presents the major conflict of the story, the danger of the cyclist getting heatstake. In the reading, the author says, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly” If the setting was in a cooler climate, the author would most likely not drank as often, and would not face dehydration. The trip would not have been as dangerous for the cyclist if the climate was different. Another element of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. In the reading it says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The rough road not only would take a toil on the authors body, but also his mind. While riding, the author thinks, “ I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph” This shows how his attitude is getting less and less optimistic as well as keeping his mind on his thirst. Thinking of his thirst would only get him more thirsty. The small change in terrain had a large impact on the authors journey. Perhaps the most influential element of the setting is the isolation. Only until the end of the story does the cyclist run into another human. Up until that point, He was all alone, having to deal with his thirst and fatigue on his own. If the setting had been in a more urbanized area, the cyclist could have gotten help from other people, which would have made his ordeal very easy. Also known, that nobody was going to help him played a large role in the mental state of the author. In conclusion, the conflict of this story was set up by the setting. If the setting were not hot, rough, and isolated, the cyclist would have had an easy journey, and the story would not have been as exciting or interesting. A different setting in my opinion would have ruined the story."	3	3		3																					
6051	3	"The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist was going through the desert, it had be dry old, dirty “…. I came to a fork of sorts, One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the largest mule greeted me. This side was troubling. “when she wanted to us the rusty water pump farlike substance oozed out and the water seem like to be @NUM1 degrees. “Not two miles into this next section of ride, I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. “This made it more difficult for the cyclist to ride the bike. This would make the cyclist more tired. As the cyclist moved on it was getting more tire and his water supply was going down. It was try me to keep his balance while he kept riding"	1	1		1																					
6052	3	"How the setting of the place effects the cyclist is for one its to dry a cyclist would be ridy for haurst shouldn’t be in a place that’s dry.Like in the story it says “I was travelling through the high parts of California in June” meaning it was really hot and dry.Second would be the animals there dangerous.A cyclist should be riding in a place with diamond back snakes it says in the text “I toiled on.At some point,tumbleweeds crossed my path t a ridiculously larger skilt it really did look like adiamond back” which if it really has one would be really dangerous  & cyclist should not be riding in that type of dangerous places no matter what type there are.That is how the settings of the surrandings effect the cyclist & how can it’s a bad place for them to ride."	2	2		2																					
6053	3	"The features of the setting affect the cylceist by the ground would change terrian a lot makeing it difficult to ride at the same speed the entire way. Also, the lack of water made it hard to focus. I think the features of the setting affect the cycleist by people think they are worse than the actually are."	1	1		1																					
6054	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The setting affects the cyclist because the weather is very hot and humid which makes him sweat which is using up energy because his body is trying to stay cool. Also the setting affects the cyclist because there is no water so on top of sweating being out of energy he has no water to refuel his body which makes it very hard for him to keep going.	1	1		1																					
6055	3	In this story the cyclist is going through a desert of California. This is a reason why he is very limited on water supply. It is really hot which would cause him to drink a lot more water. He had started his journey in the morning so that the sun wasn’t as hot as it would be in the middle of the day. Then it started to get a lot more sonny. So with the sun comes more heat. The rider says “The sun was beginning to beat down.” This would help the readers realize what time a day it was and how hot it was. This was in the morning so he didn’t realize it but as it got into the afternoon he realized it and started to get dehydrated. 	2	2		2																					
6056	3	"The wonderful features and settings had a dramatic affect on the author. The affect was bad rather that good. First, there was the almost unbearable heat. The author had limited amount of water and used a lot of it because of the smoltering temperatures. Another feature that had a great impeidence on the author’s well being would be the lack of water in the pumps he stumbed across at the snack. Lastly would be the tar-like substance that came out of the pump when author tried to get water. There was also Brackish water in the that tasted suspiciously like Battery acid."	1	1		1																					
6057	3	"The cyclist is traveling through a rough part of California during the hot month of June. The author describes part of part of his journey; ""I was traveling through the high deserts of california in june."" The heat of the sun and not much water around is causing the cyclist to worry about his health. A little further into his journey realizes how bad he could get if he doesn't find water soon. The author write, ""the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke. ""As the cyclist has run out of water & there is no sign of life around, he begins to feel that he @MONTH1 never make it through the desert to yosemite National Park.The author describes this ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. ""The setting of the cyclist""s journey greatly affected how he percieved his journey."	3	3		3																					
6058	3	"The features of the setting affect to cyclist because of where he is. The biker is in a campground in California. By saying that one could sense it is a dusty place. Also, when the story says that the “town” had been abandoned. This also tells us that the place the cyclist is in is a diserted place without many people or places to stop. The story also talks about a snake in the road. A snake in the road tells one that the town is desireted I could tell that this “town” is deserted because around here, people do not goin towns that don`t have buildings. It a snake was in the road, then the town must be empty because around here streets are busy and no snakes in the road."	2	1		2																					
6059	3	"The setting greatly affects the cyclist because he is the one riding over, “short rolling hills,” and arround a,“ridiculously large snake,” and because its hot he could suffer from heatstroke at any minut. So yes the author is affected by the setting"	1	1		1																					
6060	3	The affects of the features around them affect them by the hot bikes so the bikers need water and also it affects them by the roads are so hill so they can’t just road. Stight so they need to go over the hilles and that affects them because cycles are very hard to land form a jump.	1	1		1																					
6061	3	"The features of the setting in Yosemite give the cyclist something in look forward to, but the feature of the sorting that he is in enduse in get there causes him despaire. As soon as the cyclist passes a ghost town and notices swettering hed of the sun during early endeavers of the trip he checks himself up as he says,""I brely noticed it [the sun], the cool pines and rushing hills of Yosemite had my name written all over them. Although the cyclist began to feel the toll that the trip and the sun was going to take on him, he erased the morning with the hope and bealy of arriving at Yosemite. The more the cyclist noticedthe sun the more he drank untill his water supply seemed low, striping as an old rusty water pump he had hope of being replenished but the taste of bitter battery acid caused the cyclist to stop drinking. The rolling hills, Sun and tumbleweds did nothing to quech the cyclist thirst or at least divert his assertion. If the cyclists was to see a sign that said Yosemite @NUM1 miles away his spirits would have risen, instead he saw a sign that said, ”Rough Road Ahead” which did nothing to help him. If the terrain was more poporsed, easier to travel on and in plenty supply of water, the tune of this passive would be more hoped instead in such despair, the features of the setting caused the cyclist grief instead of hope."	3	3		3																					
6062	3	" The bike rider in the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by @PERSON1, is greatly affected by the condition of land around him. He is riding through the extremely dry desert and is running, low on water. However since it is such a dry place he can’t find any. Also since it is out in the middle of no where, there is no one he can ask for some. If this story was set somewhere else he wouldn’t have has either problems."	1	1		1																					
6063	3	"In ""rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Many visual features create a very deserted area thats hott in your head. For example in paragraph five they use alot of adjectives to describe how abandon the place was. Words like ramshackle and rusty. Also how often the lack of water was brung up made us think of how hott this California desert must have been. Also the heat made the cyclist belive he was seeing a miracle when he saw the Welch’s fruit juice factory. The choice of visual words in this story are words to describe what affected the cyclist."	1	2		2																					
6064	3	"In the passage,the cyclist had about @NUM1 different settings. One of these settings were the rough terrains he had to pass through where he lacked on the amount of water.Another setting the cyclist had to go through was the hill like terrains.Where he was laughing at himself for taking the old men advice in the first place.Both of these features had a great a tall on the cyclist body strength and his spirit. But with confidence, determination, and the relief of the success he was able to overcome the obstacles."	2	2		2																					
6065	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the weather in California in June was hot and the water the cyclist found in the pipes was hot, as well. The text says, “Somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This affected him because he had no water to drink from. Another example is when he had to overcome tumbleweeds and snakes. The text states, “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” This was an obstacle that he had to overcome. Another example is he was deserted. The text says, “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.”"	2	2		2																					
6066	3	"The setting in the features of the cyclist is that if it is too hot or too cold, it could affect how the cyclist is riding . If it’s to hot the cyclist would get exhausted a lot faster . And if it’s to cold then the cyclist would @MONTH1 be get sick . Also if it‘s  too windy then he would go a lot slower if he is going in the wind’s direction."	1	1		1																					
6067	3	The features that affected the cyclist was plenty of things. One thing would be lack of water. In the text he said the pump gave water that taste like battery acid. Another one would be all the surroundings changed from what the old men sald and he got lost. When he was lost he had to have determination to find someone say that he could survive.   	1	1		1																					
6068	3	"The setting and it`s features affect the cyclist greatly. He is in the desert and all the town's are abandoned. Also he now hits a sign that says “Rough Road Ahead…(kurmaskie, pg @NUM1). This makes his trip even worse because now he has to make it over not only big hills but torn up, old, beaten roads. And he has the sun beating down and is almost out of water."	2	1		2																					
6069	3	"The features of the setting affect the the cyclist by giving him obstacles to overcome when he had to go down the winding hills, he would have to slow down so he could manuver the hills and not lose control of the bike. The heat he was facing would cause tiredness and dehydration. If exposed to the sun and heat long enough you can get a sunburn or suffer a heat stroke. A heat stroke can be fatal to anyone, especially those with heart problems. Dehydration also can be fatal. If the cyclist does not see any buildings, he would not be able to tell where he is and he might get lost because of it. Getting lost will also lead to dehydration, tiredness, and heat stroke."	1	2		2																					
6070	3	"The setting and features affect the cyclist because with each building he hopes for water, but since he is traveling through a desert water is in limited supply and many empty buildings are left out in the wastland. These buildings create a feeling of releve in the cyclist anty to be followed by despair to find them abandoned. The land with no features also creates a feeling of lost hope in the rider making his entire ordeal that much harder. Over all it was an excureiatly experience physicly and mentaly for the cyclists."	2	2		2																					
6071	3	"In 'Rough @CAPS1 Ahead' the features of the setting and the cyclist’s surroundings greatly influence him. Because he is in “the high deserts of California in June,” the climate is hot, dry, and miserable. Another feature of the setting that affects the cyclist, is that he is out in the middle of nowhere. There are no other human beings, cars or buildings for miles. Also, the terrain affects the biker. When the road starts to get bumpy and uneven, it causes him to exhaust his water supply even faster. Overall, the cyclist in this story is greatly affected by his surroundings."	2	2		2																					
6072	3	"In the short story the cyclist was affected by the setting in many ways. The author was running out of water throughout the whole story. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” There was a limited amount of water in the bottles. He had to travel a long distance. “Not two miles into the next section.” He was getting tired quick. Also the terrain was not good. “I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” It get harder and harder to continue his ride."	2	2		2																					
6073	3	"The cyclist was so set on seeing cool, piney trees and lakes, that when he saw dirt, snake, and no source of civilization worried him. More affectively, what he didn’t see scared him most. He did see windy rivers or trails hidden beneath all kinds of trees. He didn’t see any people or friendly little forest critters. Instead he just saw the same rusty color of dirt and the occasional snake. His mood was affected and he started to lose confidence and hope. He wasn't used to the new surroundings and for a while doubted if he could even make it out alive. When he came across the run-down building of Welch’s factory, he was even more distraught. Fortunately, he did find civilization when he came to a fishing supply shop. This definetly boosted his spirits. Once he had saved his thirst problem and assured himself he has alive and would luckily stay that way, he sat down before wading out again in search of his destination."	2	1		2																					
6074	3	"The features in the setting are not very good for the cyclist. He’s in California in June, and it’s very hot. It’s pretty much a desert. When he stops for water, the pump he finds does not have any more water in it except for a few drops. Also, the few drops that he does get taste like battery acid. So this is not very good for the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6075	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the author changes the mood by not only telling us how the cyclist feels, but also by describing his environment. As he's leaving the “resevoir compground” he’s feeling pretty good because he’s just leaving “the serenity of an early-summer evening and he’s headed toward “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” He’s in a beautiful setting and this affects the cyclist because he’s anticipating another one. However, when he moves to the “ghost town” and the “sun was beginning to beat down” he’s less confident and becoming more doubtful about the mens advice. However, he’s still optimistic, finally it funny that it was once “a thriving little spot.” Next, when the cyclist comes to “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a coral” he knows that things are in bad shape and he @CAPS1 water. However, all the have is a “tarlike substance” so he moves on, having no choice. When he comes to the “rough road tumbleweeds and a ridiculously large snake” it effects the cyclist by letting him know that things are at their worst and he can either give up, or keep pushing through. I doubt it could get any worse, and so does the cyclist. Finally, at the end the cyclists enters a rather modern bathroom” and things are back to civilization for him, so he feels relaxed, relieved and much better. "	3	3		3																					
6076	3	"There are @NUM1 features of the setting that affects the cyclist on his journey. There is a lack of water, in the middle of nowhere, and nobody’s there. Due to lack of water, this feature really affects the cyclist. He will need water in all to move and get through his journey. Water is the main thing he should have. He could end up getting dehydrated and might cause him to die right in the middle of the street. Therefore water is one feature that affects the cyclist.  Furthermore he’s in the middle of nowhere. There is no buildings or nothing around, not even gas stations so where it is can stop and if he had money he would be able to buy about @NUM2 or @NUM3 bottles of water and maybe even a few snacks. That is another feature that will affect him. Lastly nobody’s around town in able to help him out or anything. Let’s say that he gets lost and he’ll need direction to get wherever he’s going well there’s nobody around in able to help him get around or anything. In conclusion those are the @NUM1 main features that will defentily affect the cyclist. "	1	2		2																					
6077	3	"The settings affect the cyclists for many reasons. One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isn’t very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it @MONTH1 not feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6078	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist by him going through obstacles to get to town. The setting was in a desert in California in June. The cyclist also had a lack of water and when he found a pump he said it was black and tasted like battery acid. And then he stopped for directions and the men gave him the oldest set of directions. So the cyclist said he would stick to his trusty map.	2	2		2																					
6079	3	"In the text, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. For example, the text states, “There was no one in sight, not a building, or structure of any kind.” This made the cyclist very lonely and they started to lose hope of finding water. Secondly, the text stated, ""In an ironic twist the building abandoned years easlier, by the looks of it-had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory” This made the cyclist lose more hope, after he thought the building would have people in it and he got excited. Lastly, the text states, “GRAPE AND @CAPS1’S FISH CAMP” The sight of this building gave the cyclist hope and happiness for finding a place to get a drink. The setting’s features greatly affect the cyclist's feelings."	2	3		3																					
6080	3	"The features of the setting made the cyclist’s ride longer and harder than he expected. When the cyclist first headed out the road was flat and smooth. Halfway through his trip the “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The cyclist continues to pedel even though he was slowed down to 12 mph. The hills made the ride slower and harder because of the hills. Tuoards the end of the hills he had to make it “Over on long, crippling hill”. The word “crippling“ is used to show the phisical affect that the hill had on him. The hills were a feature of the setting which made the cyclist’s ride longer, harder, and more phisically demanding."	1	2		2																					
6081	3	There are numerous features in the setting that effect the cycleist. For example  the rough road. A nother example is the tumble weed and the snake also affected the cyclist. In conclusion those are the reasons the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
6082	3	"Sun, amount of miles, people all are reasons why the setting affects the cyclist. For example, the sun was beating down on him every time and the cyclist seemed to complain that it was so hot. Also, he said that he really didn’t seem to notice it through in his mind it affected the cyclist. Next, the amount of miles that the cyclist was biking affected him mentally because people kept,"	1	1		1																					
6083	3	The setting is like a desert with no water or people civilizations anywhere around him. This make him more worried because if he dies know one will know for days or weeks probably.	1	1		1																					
6084	3	"There are several features that the cyclist encountered, and all of them affected the cyclist. For example, “several rusty bumps,” is a quote of the text explaining that he wasn’t riding on smooth ground he was riding on rough, hard, bumpy ground. Also he had a huge lack of water he was water depleted he couldn’t even go the speed limit, he was going 12 mph, he could have been going 55 mph. “Rough roads ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit,''  this is another quote expressing the dangers in the ride that he was risking. All these things made the cyclist uncomfortable, dehidrated, and very tired."	3	2		3																					
6085	3	"The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was a very large factor of the story that was actually the cause of the protagonist’s problem throughout. First it started off with the large hills he had to ride up, making him work harder and tire himself out quickly. Next the big problem was the heat of June, “ and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because ” The heat was so really bad because it made him hot, thus depleting his water supply [which he needed to survive] and it gave the large, almost inevitable risk of falling from a heatstroke and dying. The heat also made the abandoned Juice Factory all the more ironic and bitter for the protagonist. “A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.” @CAPS1, in the unbearable heat with no water left and @CAPS2 knows how many miles left to cycle, this really made him feel like the sorriest, unluckiest man in the world. The setting overall, seemed almost crafted to make the protagonist not only suffer from the natural elements, but from things that seemed meant purely taunt him for it. "	3	3		3																					
6086	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is hard to go far on a bike when the place, you are ridding is dry, abandoned, a quiet, hot cold and straight forward. It tells you that the setting is abandoned when if says “there was none in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind"". This would make it hard for a cycler because you need a good water supply and thats hard to keep when there is nothing around."	1	1		1																					
6087	3	The cyclist choose to take an old abandoned route to @LOCATION1. The route had in some places no buildings at all to see making the cyclist loss hope of his need for water. Until the end there was no one on the route making him all alone. So if something happen who would know. During his adventure he ran out of water making him dehydrated that didn’t help. The setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
6088	3	"The features of the setting effected the cyclist very much. The text says, “The sun was beginning to beat down”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The hot sun was making the cyclist sweat. He was losing water. This was making him dehadrayted faster. The text says. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The hills the cyclist had to ride up were wearing him out. He was getting tierd faster. The text says. “I stubled into a rather modern in bathroom and drank deeply from the sink"" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The modern bathroom had good, cold water. This allowed the cylist to drink from it. The water replenished the cyclist allowing him to regain some of his strength. Then the cyclist could carry on."	2	2		2																					
6089	3	"In the eassy “DO NOT Exceed posted speed limit,” It is a clear cut for survival as it seems that this man is fighting to stay alive. As l know cyclists pedal for hours at a time and sometimes for hundreds of miles of he was biking where green grass and cool mountains collide the tone and mood of the essay would of beam completely different.He uses sentences such as “… of two hundred degrees, deteriorating brain, birds would pick me up clean and drop from heatstroke.” @CAPS1 all make me want to read further in the essay to see lf he will be ok by thes end of his journey? I know what the feeling is when you are low of fluids because l have chronic dehydrated. I couldn’t imagine biking and only seeing desert hiss and passing tumble weed. It sounds like an awful experience. If he were somewhere cooler and colorful his experience wouldnt of been so horrific."	3	3		3																					
6090	3	"There are many ways that the setting affected the cyclist. One way is in the story when it says that it was very hot, he could become dehydrated and could possibly have a heat stroke, also the rodes were windy. This could be a problem because hes tired so he might not be able to go around the turns, he might just keep going straight and then get lost even more. That is all about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story."	1	1		1																					
6091	3	"The features in the setting of ""Rough Road ahead"" affect the cyclist. First of all, the weather causes most of his problems. Since the cyclist was biking in a california desert in June the temperature had to be in the @NUM1's. This causes him to become dehydrated, which is evident when he states, ""I had been hitting my water bottles quite regularly"" The heat therefore causes the cyclist to drive excessively and run out of water, also, the objects the cyclsit comes across on his journey affect him. For example, while riding on a rough path, ""a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This saves the biker progress and most likely scared him. The cyclsit is greatly affected by the features in the story setting."	2	3		3																					
6092	3	"The cyclist was affected by the heat. The fact was June , hes in the desert and has low on water were what almost lead to his own down fall. This hot desert setting sounds hostile and am I’m surprised he lived and that he was that lucky."	1	1		1

6094	3	"The setting affects the cyclist in a large way. He has a hard time going on his journey. He began to lose hope, get tired, and began to think he was going to die. The settings played the biggest role. It was very hot with no people or buildings around him. He had very little water and no place to get anymore. He then encountered a large snake which made it worse because he was in fear with no one around to help him. If he would have followed his own directions instead of the old men he would not have had this problem. The setting around him really made his trip a hard one with no water, people, towns, or buildings around him."	1	1		1																					
6095	3	"The features of the setting in the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” greatly affected the cyclist. In the beginning of this man’s journey he was confident in his abilities. “I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.”  The cyclist was prepared for an exciting day and the setting supported this feeling. ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" @CAPS1, as the setting began to change and his water ran out, the cyclist's attitude changed. He was “traveling through the high deserts of California in June” without much water and begun to feel desperate. As more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared he went into despair. “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake - it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” He was in the middle of nowhere with no one around and because of this setting he lost hope of surviving. He thought he was going to die of heat stroke, not having any water left, on these short rolling hills and under the extremelyly hot sun. The cyclist was affected by the features of the setting, going from confidence, to desperation and despair, and then to relief, the changes in setting caused his change in attitude throughout this journey.

6096	3	"The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, “affect  the cyclist in major ways. First, when the cyclist sees the grape juice factory, he is reminded that he is out of water and is doubtful about even living. The text states, “…A young   pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung  my head “   (Kurmaskie @NUM1 ). The  text later states, "" At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path..."" (kurmaskie). This tells that the cyclist feels de pressed and is majorly affected by these sights. This could and would later ruin his self esteem and think about diying."	2	2		2

6098	3	"The setting of the essay didn’t really help the author at all on his journey. There were not many structures on the way. Either that, of the towns said to be, “a ghost town.” @CAPS1 this couldn’t have reassured the author that things were going his way. It also was very hot during his journey. The author says he is “traveling through the deserts of California in June.” Deserts are very hot places and June is during summer which is the hottest month so it had to have been extremely hot and humid. @CAPS1 all this must have taken a toll because he never really saw anything reassuring until the last town he reached with the bait store. So the setting definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels."	3	2		3																					
6099	3	The features that set the affect of the cyclist is very clear in case of this essay which resene when it @CAPS1 the signs  that said “Rough @CAPS2 ahead: Do not Exceed posted Speed Limit.” That had to slow down his bike. “Then he said that their were no building or cars nowhere	1	1		1

In the essay, it states, “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the tradition of a ghost town.” This statement might affect the cyclist in the way that, they fear if they get into any trouble there is no one around to help out. This statement can also mean that they fear that they are going the wrong way. In the essay, it states, “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral they couldn’t had in the larger mule greeted me.” This statement simply gives the cyclist the impression that this particular town is juice, and that nobody has even been known to live here in years, @MONTH1 be decades. The different features of the journey of the cyclist in the essay, many would fear the outcome,if they over fear the journey and turned “old timers” who had never left their porches, in order to experience such things.

The cyclist took his advice, he thought that he would be there really soon so he start to drink his water really fast. He realized that he was out of water and the park he was going to wasen’t anywhere near. The cyclist got frustrated and angry he was now crossing the desert which was making him tiered and dehydrated. He pased this road that was a rough road with tumbleweeds and snakes he kept on going until he sow the “@CAPS1 Juice” company. He hurried there, went into the bathroom drank same water. When he got out an old men asked if he needed directions, the cyclist said no."	2	2		2																					
6103	3	"During the passage “Do not exceed speed limit”, the cyclist endures many hardships. One of those countless hardships was the setting that he was in. while he was lost, thirsty, and exhausted, he remained all the while in “The high deserts of California in June”. This shows that the temperature most of been unbearable. This would cause the cyclist to tire out and dehydrate faster than usual. Also, the surface he was riding on had many steep hills, as it is said when he says “over one long, crippling hill,” This shows that the hills took a lot of energy to get up. And finally, the author says that “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" This shows that if he needed help, there was no one around to lend him a hand. That is how the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way."	2	2		2

Through these our settings the effects change. Some good effects some harsh effects. The first setting that is described do you is, ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" This setting gives you a vivid picture of were the cyclist is heading. This setting also establishes a happy sort of mood. Let the pretty picture is about to change. Not so much further in to the cyclist ride he noticed a change of terrain,"" flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is short on water, and is becoming very tyered. Seeing this just crushes his spirit. @CAPS1 riding hills hard, but ridding hills with our knowing of something good waiting for you on the other side of the hills. Both of these, very different settings gives off very different feeling. The first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride. But this all changes when he hit those horrible hills. Just the thought of having so ride over miles of hills, makes your legs hurt. Over all the features of the setting saposed an intense bike ride for the cyclist, followed by a reward by beautiful place.      "	3	3		3																					
6106	3	"The author had to bike through extremely hot weather. This made him feel sweat a lot. The narration states, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt” (@NUM1). This caused him to drink water until he ran out. The narration states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (@NUM1). He then had to suck on pebbles which he could have choked on. The narration states, “With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat”(@NUM1)."	1	1		1																					
6107	3	"In the story “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit” there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist.

The tarrain got more bumpy & hard to cross. The effected the determination the cyclist had left @CAPS2 the regreted not listening to the old men of didn’t think they knew what they were talking about.

For example his mood changes when the old man asks him for a map and his attitude changes by cautiousness of the new, of the new road he went on then terror when he thought he was gonna die “ I was gonna die and the birds would pick me clean” then to pride when the old man asks for a map and the author says “I own a very good map” But as he journeys to Yosemite the setting changes when he goes to a  desert type of place then goes a bait shop to rest. Then probably on his merry way to his destination."	2	2		2																					
6110	3	"'Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit’ by Joe Kurmaskie demonstrated that the features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. First off, the cyclist was in the desert on a bicycle. This affected her because if they had been in a car, or on a bus alot less energy would have been used up. Secondly, the cyclist started running out of water. This setting didn’t help because they were on a bike so that kept them hydrated. Another setting that affected the plot was the deserted towns. If they hadn’t been deserted everything would have been better. These features affected the cyclist a great deal."	1	2		2																					
6111	3	"The features of the setting affects the cycles such that it was affecting his altermmation to continue. For example, after @NUM1 miles he looked upon the “ramshackeled sched, several rusty bumps and the corral… This sight troubled me. In the desert his water tasted like the flavor of “battery acid.” It also goes on to say that it was a “test for my inner spirit.” It also states that he went along with a few drops of water through the tumbleweeds. This passage shows obstacles he had to go through in which he did and made it with a little confidence. Although his situation was somewhat unbearable he still kept striving on."	2	2		2																					
6112	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist in most of the story. The heat made him hot & thirsty while the travel gave him a lack of energy and even     of a need for water. In paragraph @NUM1 the writer says one of the hills was “long and a               “ The hill was wearing him out & draining what was left of his energy.

If a town was abandoned or a road was, automatically then won’t be any noticable building structures for a while. Also, the and and shape of the road seemed to be very dangerous for the cyclist not only because of the narrow and rocky path but because of the wildlife. In the text, it says how a diamond back snake, poisoness was directly infront of the cyclist. That example explains on how the wildlife might exceed to more dangerous creature. Finally, the temperature, whether it was hot or cold he cyclist was limited to water & being completely dehydrated was a huge caution for the cyclist. The conditions of the setting of the setting the cyclist was in became a disadvantage for him."	3	3		3

6115	3	How the features of the setting affect the cyclist by taking and not had the right setting. The features are just not right and and they could be changed around a little bit and still have about the same meaning of the essay. So I think they should change it around.	1	2		2

The weather outside was starting to get to him, and he said, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage…” When your petalling through the desert on a hot day it is going to have effects on you.

6117	3	"There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature is the weather. When a cyclist is on a trip the weather could affect the setting greatly. An example, if it started to rain the roads could become very slippery and dangerous to ride your bike on. The cyclist and his bike could crash and die. Just cause of the weather. Another feature is the animals. An animal is important cause any were you do the are different animals that do different things. If the cyclist knows  the animals around the area that he is traveling he could keep safe and not be harmed. Ti’s better to know the area and feel safe. Then not knowing what’s going to happen next."	1	1		1

The route was very discouraging .all the cyclist wanted wanted   was water and the route kept touenting him with false hope. At the first town he noticed a water pump, but all he could get of it was sludge and water that tasted like battery acid. Next he came to a deserted old building that approved to be an old bottling factory for Welch’s  grape  juice.

Also, everyone was gone from the towns so every town he came to was hauntinghim until he got mad at the lodgers hetalked to and was really frustrated.

Then next come the rolling hills and incline in elevation, going up hill means his body working, harder, and burning calories and his much needed water supply. Then there is the man much torture. A speed limit of @NUM1,were he is going a tough 12.

This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time... refer the @NUM1 word war.” He is saying that the town could’ve given him more water and enery, but it appeared that it was over for this town. Additionally, he biked across a water pump that was well needed He tried to pump water but got no success. “I pumped the handle for several minutes but the water wouldn’t cool down.” A working water pump would’ve been huge for him giving him more strength to bike. However, once again it was very misleading"	2	2		2																					
6135	3	"This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” That changes the effect because by saying that it will show how tired he is going to be or the work trying to make it over the hills. Another example would be “high deserts of California in June.” That’s saying its hot outside and very tiring. I think it means that because in California its really hot and in June the “summer time” its very tiring. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.  "	1	2		2																					
6136	3	The features affect the cyclist because of how the road is made. If the road is a downhill ride the cyclist might ride faster. The road might be up the hill so he @MONTH1 go slow. There could be a possibility that the road might have bump rocks or grass on it that could be something tough to ride through. So the affect of the cyclist is depending on how the roads are made.	1	1		1																					
6137	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist because the worst the features get the more he wants water. For example, in the essay it said at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculous large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me when I think of tumbleweeds I think of dryness because it is like dry grass and when I think of snakes I think of heat because that is the time for snakes to come out when ot gets hot. So the cyclist was thinking about dryness of his throat and the dryness of his sorrounding making him want water. Another feature is when he seen a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth probably making the cyclist wishing he could have that cold refreshing drink."	2	2		2																					
6138	3	In “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclists was effected by the features of the setting. She was first effected by the old men which told her a “shortcut” to her ride to Yosemite National Park. Then she was effected by a ghost towns which had no water to give her. Then she was almost dehydrated when she came to a rickety road which had a few tumbleweed and a huge snake which was quite difficult to get by. Then at the end she came upon “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp” where she decided to make decisions herself. All of these things in the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way except “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp” which saved her from dehydration.	2	2		2																					
6139	3	"In the short story, ”Rough Road Ahead”, the cyclist faced with many problems. One of these is the feature of setting. I believe it has a big affect. The setting is in a dessert, which is very hot, there is no water around and usually nobody lives in a dessert. @CAPS1 thing is that he was running out of water. In the text it says, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.“ @CAPS1 setting of the book that affects the cyclist is that it is in June. June is a very hot month, especially when the cyclist is in a dessert traveling many miles."	2	2		2																					
6140	3	"The settings of cyclist affects the way cyclist perform. If the weatheris too hot then the cyclist might slow down because of the sun beating down on them. If its too cold, the cyclist puts on more clothes which might weigh them down from achieving the speed they need to obtain. The bike has to be stable. Riding on rough roads, braking, speeding, chains in good conditions. The area were the cyclists rides sets the mood. If its a nice scenary the cyclist might be in a wonderful mood as to the scenary being dark and gloomy with nasty weather behind it the cyclist might not be as happy as they could be. These typess of things @MONTH1 help determine how settings can affect the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6141	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” the setting greatly affects the cyclists. The @LOCATION1 desert climate burrows down upon the cyclist. For example the was further route, he takes is not only @LOCATION1, but also has no place to get water. The heat and lack of water combine for deadly dehydration upon the cyclists. The setting now forces the cyclist to become more determined if he wants to live. He must continue and pray for a town to come up, so he @MONTH1 restock on water and become hydrated once again."	2	2		2																					
6142	3	"Many different things affected on his way to Yosemite National Park, but the environment he was in played the biggest role in his journey. The cyclist was in a dry, desert area where tumble weeds were more common than people. When the cyclist came across the old men and asked them for directions, they led him to a “ghost town” there was no water for the dehydrated cyclist who had been baking in the extremely dry, hot weather. This caused a problem where the cyclist thought that he would die in the desert because of the weather, directions he was given, and lack of water. When the cyclist come across the bait shop he know he was saved. He became rehydrated and declined directions from an old man because these features of the setting are what caused his problems in the first place: old men, dry weather, and water."	2	2		2																					
6143	3	"There are a couple things that affect the cyclist in the story. One of the ways he is affected is de hydration. In the story about dehydration it says “ The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” A good affect on the cyclist was no one in sight to slow him down on his bike ride. A bad affect on him  was don’t ask direction from a guy from heat strokes on a gorgeous day in June simply because listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been left their porch in decade, caused me to laugh”. One more thing that got in his way was the poisonous snake."" At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake--It really did look like a diamond back.. Blocked the major of the parement in front of me""."	3	2		3																					
6144	3	The cyclist knowing not where he was going got a wrong enformation and he followed it. He was excited to know that he knows where he’s heading too. Along his journey he was aciccted with a lot of things like the sun. The weather condition of their exaction and the big snake he saw. He was affected by sun because he was dehydrating and he almost had no water left for him as it was also becoming so hot alike makes the journey very difficult for and made his mood strange while also following the direction he was disfernded by a big snake he encounter at the case slic desn't while succeed their add was scared that he was going to be attacked unlike anyone to make his way through. The features affects him because he doesn’t know where he was going and he wait a as her cut.” Then he was going to wrong direction and he wasn’t prepared for the journey because the weather condition was” summer time” it was hot and he was riding a bicycle not a car.	3	2		3																					
6145	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist with his train of thought. On page @NUM1 it says, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This gives a sence of heat and foreshadows maybe the lack of water he’ll have later on. As he passes a snake, “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” So the cyclist is most likely begin to feel dizzy and begins to loose hope. On page @NUM2 he says, “…I could drop from heatstroke…” meaning he’s starting to think of the worse possible things that could happen. Which effects him because he’s beginning to loose hope and  thinks he’s not going to make it. On page @NUM3, he says, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean…” By this point the conditions he was having were rough and making him worry. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist throughout the story."	2	3		3																					
6146	3	"With little water the setting was not helpful to the cyclist. Joe @PERSON1 said, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” (@PERSON1). After receiving bad directions from a few old men having people passing by in cars or near by stores would probably help the cyclist for asking directions. @PERSON1 said, ""working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength"" (@PERSON1). Having no water to replenish your body will make you weak and unstable. In the middle of no  where that is a problem. @PERSON1 also said, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (@PERSON1). With little water left and a weak body it must have been hard going up and down those @NUM1 also said, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (@PERSON1).

6147	3	"The setting in the story affected the cyclist. The setting takes place in June. It is very hot and the cyclist is getting very dehydrated. You can imagine how hot it got when it said, “wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage.” It also sounded in the story that it felt like two hundred degrees when the sun was beating down"	2	1		2																					
6148	3	The features of the setting affect the cycleist in many diferent ways. For example it was June and he was in the @CAPS1 of California. It was very hot and the dehydrated him. Also he did no know where he was going so he had to rely on other people directions. Also he had to keep dehydrate. That what affected the cycleist. 	1	2		2																					
6149	3	"The features of the settings in “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie were rough and challenging. A biker rides through todi, California which is a rough area to ride. The ride was hot and long that he was so dehidrated that sweat was dried around his neck. The solo cyclist says “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” He had no where to get water or food. It was deserted. He thought if he died no one would find him faster the birds would pick him clean. The essay “rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit by @PERSON1 shows a solo cycilist are very independent."	2	2		2																					
6150	3	"In the story, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faced many obstacles. For example, he had to get directions to Yosemite National Park, but the directions were from elder men, whose information was out of date. In addition, the cyclist had to decide which way to take when there was a fork in the road. He chose a path the old men said would have a town nearly eighteen miles down the road. Furthermore, the cyclist ran into flat roads that went to rolling hills, snakes blocking his path, and a dehydration state that could’ve killed him. In conclusion, this man overcame obstacles to get to Yosemite National Park."	2	2		2																					
6151	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affects the cyclist in various different ways. First of all he listened to the old man so he was on the wrong path. So he travels and it’s a hot June day in California deserts. The odds are against him from the start “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I needed a drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…”(Kurmaskie @NUM1) From the ganle you can tell that hes tired and almost out of water. It puts a lot of strain on the cyclist but he manages."	2	2		2																					
6152	3	"The setting clearly has a huge effect on the cyclist. The flat roads are easy and smooth to ride on, but as the road changes to short, rolling hills, the biking becomes more difficult. This is supported by the sentence that reads, ""Over are long, crippling hill...” This shows that the hill is a very challenging obstacle. He is also effected by the things that come with the change in terrain. For example, one sentence reads ""...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondbuck-blooked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This stresses how remote the area in which he is biking really is, and shows how it mentally and physically effects his trip.  "	2	2		2																					
6153	3	The affect of the setting are two old timers sitting on their front porch out in the desert since carter was in office. It was starting to become daylight and he  had to walk @NUM1 miles to get to the next town. So he gets on a bike and rides to the next town. The speed limit is 55 miles per hour and he  was going 12 miles per hour just like the waterflow. He was riding up and down rolling hills. He finally got to the next town to live.	1	2		2

6155	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a lot of ways. in the essay, the author describe how the setting is hot, it is bumpy, it makes him sweat, it makes him tired, he is also, running out of water from his thirst. The road gets, very rocky at one point. The narrator states “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills (Kurmaskie @NUM1). There is also a photograph that shows how rough the terrain is. It is barrain with nothing around it."	1	1		1																					
6156	3	"The feature’s of the setting affect the cyclist because, the cyclist is dehydrated and has to nde on a horrible conditions of a road, snakes and hills. All of these features act like obstacle courses, which makes it hard to do what he’s trying to do which is recieve water. Also, with the cyclist being hot and in need of water he at this point is delinous and most likely doesn’t know whats going on. In the story the authors main feature of the setting is the road. “Rough road ahead.”  This explains the cyclist having to go on a rough road, and doing that dehydrated is very dangerous these are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist.  "	2	2		2																					
6157	3	"The settings have a huge affect on the cyclist. When he first comes to the ‘@CAPS1 town” he isn’t really warried he is kind of laughing and thinks his funny by saying.” This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time  - say, before the last world war.” Then after he says that it ways he chuckled. When he gets the dark in the road with the risky pipe of water he begins to switch into conservation made and begins to get is scared. He says.” I would comer  water- a test at my inner spirit “ This showing that he was scared. After he sees the abanoned Grape juice factory he says something like birds are going to pick him clean and leave behind same expensive biking gear. This definatly shows that he is giving up. Another thing that would back this up is when he talks about writing in his diary about the old men who gives him these direction. When he finally reaches the balt shop he is releved and goes to the bathrom and drinks water. He  also says that he will buy bait even though he doesn’t have a rod. These examples show the many ways the setting affected the cyclist."	3	2		3

Just to add to the misfortune of the story. There was no one in eight, not a building, car or structure of any kind."" This factor does not help the cyclist at all, infact, all it does is make the cyclist more  exhausted. Another element in the story that effects the cyclist is the lack of water. Early on in the story the author explains, ""The water bottle contained only a few tatalizing sips."" With more miles to go,the cyclist starts to loose hope of making it to his destination alive. The feature of rolling hills also affects the cyclist. The cyclist is already tired enough, and just to  add to his misfortune, ""flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the hills are short, they still could have put impact on him because of the ropolalive hills.

It affected him because it was saying @NUM1 miles and then were in the first town, thinking that the cyclist was getting excited and he was kind of all most done he thought he was going at a fast past. When the cyclist got to the first town he said that it looked dead. And then after he kept moving he kind of knew that he wasnt getting anywhere. Then after thinking he noticed that he had listened to some old folks that had never even been off their porch. So after the cyclist had hit the first town he had known right then and there that ho should never listen to old folkes ever again. Because that first town had looked like nobody has been in it for years."	2	2		2																					
6160	3	"The features of the setting on the way to Yosemite National Park, greatly affected the cyclist. On the way to the park, the cyclist had encountered the heat of the desert in California. Besides the heat the cyclist had to overcome the rough terrain of the of the short, rolling hills. This made the cyclist tired and weary. Adding to his weakness, and the extreme heat, he also ran out of water, causing him to become dehydrated. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke...laugh.” This trip through the California desert greatly affected the cyclist by causing great exhaustion and dehydration."	2	1		2																					
6161	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the climate could be hot, the road could be bumpy, and the town could be deserted. For example, ""Rough Road Ahead.

6162	3	"Hot, lack of water, lost-all are how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, it was hot. In one sentence he say the sun was beginning to beat down. Also that the water felt around two-hundred degrees. That sweat was all over him. So he had to be really hot. Next, the lack of water affected him and his performence. How was because he was dieing in need of water. He tried everything to get water but made it through with almost no water. Lastly, he was lost. The map that he had was wrong and the trip wasnt what he expected. But in the end he was relifed. So even toward all these negative affects he still managed to come to positive. Basically this story is explaining how if you try your hardest, never give up, and try new things you are most likely to succeed in life and other things you @MONTH1 take part of. So try your best and make way of your life and plans in your life."	2	2		2																					
6163	3	The conditions the cyclist has to face are always problems or helpers. Say there is a rocky up-hill part. That will most definuntly slow him down. But if there is a nice smooth downhill part that will speed him up. and take alot of work of pedling off his hands.	1	1		1																					
6164	3	"The cyclist lost hope because he was in the California desserts in June. The cyclist started to lose hope because there was a rusty water pump that pumped out battery-acid tasting water. When he said the sign “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, was very cautious. The cyclist thought for sure that he was going to die out there. The cyclist also felt lonely because in the text it says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.

When the author comes across the “ghost town” followed by the dilapidated shack, and finally the sign that read “Rough Road Ahead,” his hope of finding Yosemite Park was gone. The hopelessness of the situation made the author want to give up, thinking that he was going to die out in the desert from dehydration and exhaustion. This can be related to anyone that has been lost in unfavorable conditions, and the feeling of helplessness and fear that goes along with it. It feels like everything is against you, with nothing working in your favor, and this is what the author experiences in his description of his trip in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.”"	3	3		3

As he began to ride into the day break of morning he had strong legs and even a smile on his face. As time went on he soon became close out of water and a loss of energy. The @CAPS1 summer day made him sweat and began to think that he birds would pluk at his body as if he would die on his ride to Yosemite.

6169	3	"The features of the setting in the essay “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” affected the cyclist in a negative way. The more and more he rode, he thought more negatively and had alot of doubt. The cyclist was not very confident, he thought he wouldn’t make it. For example, when the cyclist notices nothing in sight, his tone changes. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon telling myself that if I could make it that far , I’d be fine”. He seemed unsure and a little nervous. As the journey continued, the cyclist loses hope it seems. “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary” He does not see himself finishing this journey the more and more he rides in the middle of nowhere with nothing to be seen except “Rough Road Ahead” signs.

6170	3	"The features in the setting are very effective to the cyclist. He is in a desert area of California and he has limited water supply. It is very hot and very dry. He barely had an water to drink and he had to go a long way in the hot and humid weather. The deficiency of water could have made him became dehydrated. Another obstacle that he had during this biking trip to Yosemite National Park was the hills that he faced. At the beginning, he was on flat terrain, now he has hills that he has to pedal up that makes it a lot harder for him. One other obstacle that he faced was the snake he ran into. That setting had many obstacles for this guy. If it wasn't for the heat and lack of water, he might have been able to make it a little easier."	1	1		1																					
6171	3	"The features of the setting strongly affected the cyclist. The rolling hills were the cyclist’s most challenging problem because they were long and cripppling. Maneuvering down the hill would take a lot of energy and determination from the cyclist. Considering the cyclist was already tired and sweating from riding on rough roads and passing a large snake, riding on rolling hills would be extremely difficult. The features of the setting were not helping the cyclist stay healthy because their difficulty was causing the cyclist to become dehydrated and possibly drop from heatsroke. However, the cyclist kept a possitive attitude and did not give up. His determination saved him as he felt relief when he finally came across the ""Gary and wilbells fish camp.” In conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because they forced him to work extra hard and put forth more effort. But with determination,you can accomplish anything!  "	3	3		3																					
6172	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit.” The cyclist mood seems to change as the road and setting does. The narration states, “ a large high way sign jumped out at me. I read : Rough road ahead : Do not exceed posted speed limit … sometimes life can feel so cruel (Kurmaskie). Slowly as the terrain gets harder and harder the cyclist feels worse and worse. Every time he believes there is a town he gets happy but his dreams are soon crushed. One can see in the picture the hard cycling terrain that can affect the cyclist making him tired due to lack of water and sense of hopelessness he feels as he loses energy and believes he will die."	2	1		2																					
6173	3	Some features of the setting setting that affected the cyclist were signs that had speed limits. The sign affected the speed of the cyclist. Another feature was a hill on the route. This affected the cyclist by making him tired because he said “I wipe the sweat from my eyes.”	1	1		1																					
6174	3	"The setting had a huge affect on the cyclist. One affect was the lack of water in the area he was in, which was a dessert. Also, the lack of people in the area didn’t help the cyclist out at all. The hills on the road made it more tougher on the cyclist because it drashed what little energy he had left. Also, the sun beating down on him made his body more warm and making it harder for him to focus on what he was trying to do."	1	2		2																					
6175	3	"In the setting of “ Rough road ahead: do non excee posted speed limit.” The cyclist is greatly affected. In the beginning the authour is enjoying a nice campground outside lodi California when “old-timers” told the cyclist directions and from his piont of view  ""they'd  sounded so sure of themselves when pointing off out land marks and spouting off towns  I would come to along this breezy aunt.” So the cyclist used that information and it wasn’t for   The Better."	1	1		1																					
6176	3	"How the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when the old guy had told him do you know where to go? An the other guy was like “ yes sir! I own a very good map” so how did it change for the man that was riding this bike he saw all of those towns an a sign that said Rough Road ahead. That the man would always stick to the future. What had change was he saw all of those buildings, town, an he was going an going. I think he might stick with the future."	1	1		1																					
6177	3	"In the story the cyclist faced many problems, one of the biggest problems was the terrian that he had to maneuver them. The terrain was hilly, having to go up a hill on a bike is tireing and wears you out faster than flat land would, and making him use more energy. The heat was also unbearable making it harder for him to focus, the cyclist did everything he could to keep consiese while  manuvering threu the terrain and deserted landscape being a huge desert of rolling mountains he pushed forwad, finding no civilization anywhere to get a refill of water. For example, if the terrain wasn’t as hilled then it would of made it easier for him using less energy and less strain on his legs, the heat of the desert beating down on him probably slowed his progress also. Heat will make you move slower and a cyclist moving down a  barnest road with no shade will make the journey seem longer, and imposible. In the end his will and determination got with threw the landscape, so he could get the water he needed to finish his trip"	2	2		2																					
6178	3	"In this essay, the features of the setting cause the cyclist to become irritaed toward the old men. Ten this essay, old men give the cyclist direction, and instead of using a map, he takes their advice. However their information is out of date, and takes the cyclist through rolling hills and bumpy roads. The cyclist uses all of his energy to get to unknown towns of no importance, and with no water. The cyclist blame the old men for giving him directions that wasted his energy. However he showed realy become himself for taking their advice, and motuising a credited map on real directions."	2	3		3

6180	3	"In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie. the setting greatly affects the cyclist and his mindset. When the scenery is pretty and cheery, he is happy as well. This is shown when the author writes, “denyoved the serenity of an early- summer- evening.” This quote describes the scenery as a serre or peaceful place. His happiness is found in the first part of the quote when he said, “denyoyed” One does not enjoy something unless they are happy or in a cherry mindset. Therefore, the peaceful scery affected the cyclist by making him happy. the same can be said for merry scenery too. This is found when the author says, “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke”. This quote, describes the scenery as a place that they tumbleweeds. Steryotypically, tumbleweeds are found in dreary and lonely place. This lonely scenery takes it if full on the cyclist. He becomes pessimist and is making of all that could go wrong, not all that could get better. This is found around us every day. The poor and homeless who live with a low standard of living are often said. They have to exist with the affected the cyclist. In conclusion, the seeing does affects the cyclist and his mindset drastically."	3	2		3																					
6181	3	"The features of the setting affect of the cyclist because the setting changed so drastically. The flat wide open road turned into to “short, rolling hills”. Because he was already running out of water it was making harder for him to have the will power and determination to go up and down these hills. His determination started to fade because he started to see wide open lands with nothing but “tumbleweeds and ridiculously large snakes.” He felt like he was going to dehydrate because the sun was beating down and had no water left. He used pebbles that he had found to put in his mouth to help circulate the saliva he had in his mouth. He wishes that he would choke on one because he feels so useless.

6182	3	"In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faces many hardships on his way to Yosemite due to the features of the setting. The fact that it was a hot summer’s day contributed to his hardships. With little water, it was easier for him to get dehydrated. In the text, the author writes, “.I could drop from heat stroke, on a gorgeous day in June.” (Kurmaskie, @NUM1). This lets the reader know that the heat of June was very dangerous to the cyclist. There was also nobody around except “Old timers who haven’t left the confines of their perches since water was in offing” (Kurmaskie, @NUM2). The narrator stresses his viewpoint on taking directions from these people since their directions are as poor.

6183	3	"The terrain in “Do not exeed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist had to cope with many difficulties. He was already lacking water from the anduous journey and then the enviroment turned against him. The narration states, “I noticed the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means the cyclist is going to put forth more energy to make it up these hills. Energy he barely has. This  will drain almost all the energy the cyclist has. Another example is, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that the cyclist is in the middle of nowhere with barely any water and energy, causing even more problems. In conclusion, the setting in, “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie caused many problems for the cyclist.  "	2	3		3

The cyclist is affected by lack of water, the distance he has to travel, and the hilly terrain. “The water bottles contain only a few tantalizing sips. wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt,” this statement shows how he was out of water and was tired and hot.

Even though he had no water he was determined to keep pedeling. “Rough road Ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit” At this point he had no water left and he was pretty much in the middle of nowhere. If I was in his situation I would feel hopeless. There was no sign of hope. He just saw endless rolling hills and that was all. Then when he saw the building over the hills he thought he was home free. So he pedeled up to the building, and that with all the others was abandoned. The cyclist thought he was going to die. In conclusion the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist because seeing nothing gives him no hope. If he had cars and buildings on both sides of him that probably would have give him some confidence but that was not the case. He is in the middle of nowhere.

I hung my head.” Then when he had almost nothing left he spoted a bait shop.” Somehow I climed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” Then, as easily as rounding a bend my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.” @CAPS1 is when he saw “Gary and @CAPS2 Fish camp – If you want bait far the big ones were your best bet thus realcaving his troubles."	2	2		2

Next there is a change in terrain an he soon approaches “rolling hills” which are more difficult to bike on. Finally the author sees a sign that reads “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” and becomes discouraged because his bike is not even capable of reaching the speed limit but he still has to manage getting past the rough road. After passing this road he approaches a picture of a boy drinking juice that is posted on a juice factory.

The only water the biker can find is from an old pump, but he couldn’t drink it since it was so hot; nasty tasting. “When I tried a drop it had the flavor of battery acid” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His route was deserted, so nobody could help him. Also, the terrain was bad. The hills caused him to use more of his energy, which he needed to stay alive. “the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke caused me to laugh,” (@NUM1). He also encountered dangerous animals like the diamond black rattles back. The setting also affected him mentally because he was silently yelling at himself since he took directions from the old men. He knew he should have taken the right way, instead of trying a short cut that he now realizes is abandoned and dangerous.

He told himself that it was no use. In the story it says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die…”.

He was riding for over fifty miles through the California desert  with a limited supply of water.

In the story they cyclist said, ''I picked up some pebble and put them in my mouth. With my luer. I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didn’t really matter. I was going to die.

6239	3	"Setting is a very important element to the story “Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit: by Joe Kurmaskie. Kurmaskie experienced a harsh scenery with high temperatures, low water supply and wild animals. High temperatures without an efficient supply of water can lead to heatstroke, hyperthermia, dehydration and even death. It is very important to always be prepared with enough food and water to sustain yourself through an event such as being last. Dealing with wild life can also be an obstacle. You never know how any animal is going to react to your presence so you must be as cautionary as possible around non-domesticated animals. In conclusion, scenery and setting of a story can make all the difference of how interesting a story can be and how informative, for instance, if Kurmaskie had experienced no weather with plenty of food and water riding through a flat small town in @LOCATION1 the story would not be as interesting."	3	0		2																					
6240	3	"The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie. The setting effects how fast, hard and long the cyclist needs to pedal. For example, “…Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The cyclist was going 12 mph, where the speed limit was 55 mph. The cyclist was beginning to lose hope after reading the sign, but he kept going. Furthermore, not only was the land add pressure to the cyclist. So does the heat from the sun. For instance, the cyclist says, “… and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke…”. The heat begins to affect the authors health and his perseverance. The setting affect the mental and physical strain the cyclist has to endure."	2	3		3																					
6241	3	This story was a great motivation for older man that can still be healthy and feel like an teenager again. It showed how much effort he put to his goal and how he survive. Forty miles he peddled for forty miles to drink same water the cyclist was and interesting story not ginaupup	1	1		1																					
6242	3	It affect cyclest because the condition determines the pace and even how fast they could travel.	1	1		1																					
6243	3	"The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist was in California, which is an extremely hot place in the desert in June. These features made dehydration a more keen possibility. Another example, is paragraph ten. It explains how the rough road, tumbleweeds, and large snake made it hard for the cyclist to keep his balance without water. Also, the essay describes a building with a poster of a small child drinking a refreshing glass of juice,this made the cyclist think more about water and  become very thirsty. Although thier was some possitive effects of the setting on the cyclist. The pebbles aloud him to keep his mouth moist and not think so much of his thirst. Also, the bait shopped allowed him to opt something to drink, and not die from dehydration."	2	2		2																					
6244	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. One way it affects the cyclist is because of the weather condition. Being that it is very hot outside the cyclist does not have enough water. Another way it affects the cyclist is because of the condition alongside the road. For example the tumbleweeds and the snakes. Being that its not out most likely the desert is in process of a drought and he gets very dehydrated. I believe these are the reasons because it all makes a lot of sense and affects the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
6245	3	"The features of the setting affect the cy clist in many ways. For example the lack of water was the biggest thing. Without cool water he had nothing to reboost his energy. He would get tired out faster. Even he does find water its hot, like when he says,” brakish water feeling some where in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This shows how in “the high desert of June,"" the water is all very hot. Even after he pumped the well for several minutes the water still wouldn’t cool down the hot desert had baked everything above and below ground. So when you go to get something liquid which heats and cools faster than solids it will be hot. Also the rough road made it difficult for the cyclist to travel it. We know the roads rough when he says, “large highway signs dumped out at me. It read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. ""This also shows you couldn’t go fast."	3	2		3																					
6246	3	"The cyclist is dehydrated. He has lack of water for a significant distance before he realizes “that the old men would have been right,had he been riding,” before the last word war.” But any “town” he rode into, was just a run down, deserted, and abandoned piece of desert. He says,“It was a sad, hopeless, laugh, mind you, but at leas I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” @CAPS1 that he was getting more and more dehydrated, but was not quite ready to die. He still had enough energy to keep going, But “hope was fading.” Then all at once after climbing a large hill he gains all hope back. He sees “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp” The rider is safe now, he stumbles into the modern looking bathroom and drinks from the sink. He is now safe, ready to ride, and avoid all men who haven’t moved from their front porches in years."	1	1		1																					
6247	3	The harsh setting in “DO Not Exceed Posted Speed limit “by Joe Kurmaskie made the @CAPS1 for the cyclist more difficult due to the hot weather and the inconsistancy of the pavement. The very hot June day was a cause of the cyclist slowing down. “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This proves that the cyclist is very hot due to the summer heat. Another factor of the cyclist slowing down is the inconsistant of the pavement on the road “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” The @CAPS2 proves that the road could be slowing the cyclist also. It seems the cyclist has a lot against him. But if he keeps his head up he can make it to “Yosemite.”	3	2		3																					
6248	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the hottnes of the deserts of California because the cyclist was sweating, and drinking his water bottles. Also when the cyclist saw the building, he thought he could rest and maybe get a ride to where he was going but, the building was abandoned years earlier so the cyclist couldn’t stop. These are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6249	3	"Several features of the setting that affected the cyclist were time of year, the desert land, the lack of civilization, the lack of resources – especially water, and the rugged characteristics of the land. The cyclist was traveling during the summer time, which was the hottest time of the year. He was also traveling through the deserts which create an even hotter climate. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” was a quote from the selection that tells us this. If he had been traveling in the @DATE2, for example, he @MONTH1 have been more comfortable. Throughout his trip, the author does not after come desert civilization. He runs into a deserted factory and miles of land without people. The fact that he is traveling through desert terrain also helps us realize that water is scarce. He has trouble finding a place to get water. This made the trip extra hard and discouraging. “I was going to die” he says. As he travels farther, the land also becomes harder to travel on. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” this characteristic is a setting, like the others, negatively affects the cyclist by making his journey harder."	3	3		3																					
6250	3	"The cyclist surrounds did have an affect. In paragraph two the cyclist describes how “I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening the."" To have a wonderful day to begin with was parably assurance even thing would be fine. Confidence was a factory for the beautiful weather as well as he knew a short cut. In paragraph @NUM1 the cyclist mentions how old men looked at his map and pointed out “this breezy jaunt.” The cyclist just thought his life got a little easier. Then in paragraph @NUM2 the cyclist comes upon the ""traditional definition of a ghost town."" This setting was nothing like the old men were talking about. ""Twenty miles up the road, i came to a fork of sorts."" In paragraph @NUM3, this caused confusion and worry. ""This sight was troubling."" ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" The cyclist was ""hitting my water bottles pretty regularly."" This setting made the cyclist uncomfortable as well as the ""two hundred degrees."" The cyclist then began puzzled and distraught. ""I notices the terrain changing"" in this quote the cyclist's settings @MONTH1 have caused confusion. But in the end the cyclist suceeded. "	2	3		3																					
6251	3	"The features of the setting in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, affect the cyclist because the cyclist is in a desert with no water and trying to find a town there is further than he thinks. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This shows the cyclist did not have much confidens in this desolates area of the jerny.  "	1	1		1																					
6252	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the road could be damaged or there could be a lot of hills. One example is on pg @NUM1 “with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat”. This explains the conditions of the road could be dangerous. That is how the condition of the road can be affective.	1	1		1																					
6253	3	"When the cyclist takes off on the road again he has plenty of water, strongs legs and enjoys the sunny and warm day. But as the day gets more hot and the terrain more desert like and cough, the cyclist begins to lose his confidence, as he keeps riding, his water supply is depleting and he begins to believe that he will die. At one point, talking about the terain he says,"" i toiled on at some point, tumbleweeds crossed any path."" It sounds as if he is struggling very hard to keep going without water and a clue about where he is. When he is almost sure that he is going to die from the queruring that he says,"" i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean”. This shows that by this time his confidecnce was lost because of the insane heat and unberable terrain. He begins to lose  his sanily along with his strength because the setting around him was so terrible."	2	3		3																					
6254	3	"The features of the settings affect the cyclist in many ways when he starts of, he is bright and happy just as the slenecy is nice and calming. There is a pace that makes him feel like nothing wrong. “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” After about @NUM1 miles on the cold, his life was getting low, and he came to his second abundant place. He then felt a little disturbed and worried. He needed to find a place with water. “This site was trebling.”  There he fins water plant not his hopes rise a bit, until he finds the water isn’t good. “A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brickish water feeling some which is in the neighborhood of two hundred trees”. So he moves on and finally he re aches life! He is so relieved he can’t believe his luck.” Then as easily as rounding a body my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me “The setting affects the mood in a very big way, the cyclist feels as the setting looks."	3	2		3																					
6255	3	The features of the setting greatly effect he cyclist one way it effects him is because it is so hot and he doesn’t here any water left. Also because their are so many almost buildingc and ghost towns this gives him cables haze that he will be able get the water.	1	1		1																					
6256	3	Almost all of the cyclist’s surroundings are old and barren. Hot @CAPS1 like weather. The road is hard to ride on. “Flat Road was replaced by short rolling hills.” So his ride was a very rough and tiresome one.	1	1		1																					
6257	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by how much confidence in where he’s going and how he’s gona get there. Having no water	1	1		1

Also it depends if its in a city burbed, small town, desert, highway all these factors play a huge roll in cycling"	3	2		3																					
6260	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in @CAPS1 ways. The cyclist was in California in June weather. If it wasn’t so hot, he wouldn’t have needed water as badly. He wouldn’t have been sweating as much. Also, there weren’t any buildings or cars around, so there wasn’t anyone to help him. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structures of any kind.” @CAPS1 features of the setting could affect the cyclist."	2	1		2																					
6261	3	" In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” written by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature that affects him is that he is cycling “through the high deserts of California in June”(Kurmaskie). This affect would mean that the author would be dehydrated faster. The cyclist, author, is dehydrated before he can make it to the next town because he “gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in [his] mouth”(Kurmaskie)."	1	1		1																					
6262	3	"In the essay Do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the surrounding setting affected the cyclist. The setting was somewhere outside Lodi, California in early summer. The cyclist took advice from some old men that led him to difficult places to get out of. As the sun made things better and his water started to deplete getting to Yosemite was much harder. The cyclist was traveling through high deserts of California in June. When the terrain started to change from flat road to rolling hills the cyclist pushed himself even harder to get to his destination. The sun and hot air dehydrated him faster. After traveling over, ""along, crippling hill,”  the cyclist had to stop and even tried sucking on apebble in an effort to take his mind off thirst. When he found a habited store he was exhausted and relieved. Then features of the setting had a big effect on the cyclist. The weather dehydrated him while the terrain exhausted him.   "	3	2		3																					
6263	3	"The settings in the essay affected the cyclist mentally and physically The fact that he was riding through the desert in June affected how long his water supply lasted. If he had been riding in the @DATE1 then his water supply would’ve lasted longer and he would’ve had more energy. Since the town the old men had told the cyclist about was abandoned that also affected the cyclist because he had to keep on going even though he was getting weaker. What affected the cyclist most, I think was when he arrived at the bait store. If that had been abandoned like everything else, the cyclist would’ve died. Luckily though it wasn’t and he was able to drink water.The factory affected him mentally because the picture of the boy was haunting him in a way due to the fact he was drinking juice something the cyclist could’nt do. All in all, I think the conditions that the cyclist was in affected him. Since I’ve fainted from dehydration before I know how it feels to be without water. First you get a head ache; then your mouth dries up and desperation gets in and finally you get dizzy. "	3	3		3																					
6264	3	"The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” @CAPS1 the cyclist's physical and mental state. There are negative and positive effects for each state. The physical effects of the cyclist because of the settings all apparent throughout the story. For example, the cyclist reaches @PERSON2 and @PERSON1’s Fish Camp, he is able to hydrate once again. The positive effect makes the cyclist healthy and safe once again. The setting mentally, @CAPS1 the cyclist very substantitially. This can be seen when the cyclist in the comfortable camp around in @LOCATION1. He feels happy in this area. This positive effect prepares the cyclist to go on the trip to Yosemite. Also, when the cyclist reaches the “Ramshackle @CAPS2, several rusty pumps, and a corral, “he feels troubled. He is negatively affected mentally by the little amount of available water. In addition, the cyclist felt ""sad"" and ""hopeless” when cycling in the Dry, arid terrain. The cyclist is in the worst mental state in this place. Finally, the cyclist felt relieved upon seeing the fish camp. He describes the feeling by saying that his trouble are now “behind” him. Settings positive effect in this instance changes mental state from negative to positive. Setting was the main factor in deciding upon the cyclist’s physical and mental state. Setting @CAPS1 the cyclist’s physical and mental state in positive and mental states almost equally in the story."	3	3		3																					
6265	3	"He setting made the cyclist feel lonely. The cyclist lost hope quickly because she was never saw any people or water on the way. The cyclist said they saw a “ghost town”. Before he got to the fish camp the cyclist saw no one and was becoming dehydrated. This caused him to lose hope and at some points he thought he was going to die. For example, he says, ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” It is clear that the setting affected the cyclist in a very negative way."	2	2		2																					
6266	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was in a forest. This was a bumpy trip with a lot of troubles along the way. This was along trip. But he made it tough with a story to tell in the end.	1	1		1																					
6267	3	"The setting of the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” effects the cyclists physical and emotional attitude. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist, “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on [his] face.” It was not too hot yet in the morning. So, the cyclist was happy and strong. He was confident he could conquer anything. As the day grew on “the sun was beginning to beat down” He was beginning to drink lots of water but he was still confident and strong. “I came to a ramshackle shed [and] several rusty pumps the sight was troubling. “The cyclist was travelling in the hot deserts of California. He was becoming tired and thirsty. He had to save as much water as possible. What started as a confident ride into the desert became a survival ride. Once the cyclist findswater he is relieved. He feels more confident and can ride to his destination. The weather and setting can affect us emotionally and physically just like in the essay, the cyclist became tired both physically and emotionally as the hot, sunny day went on."	2	3		3																					
6268	3	"As the cyclist begins his journey, he is confident & exited to have been offered new directions from some “old wise men” which promise a shortcut. This water supply is mediocre & attitude willed against the flat and hilly terrain, untill he realizes the directions are way off  target. The cyclist was making his way to Yosemite when he came to the first “town” but it wasn't a town but more of a ghost dwelling. As he continued hoping the shortcut offered by the old “codgens” would actually materialize, he realized he was utterly alone in the hot desert wt a depleting water supply & dwindling spirit. He was disturbed that he had chosen to follow the advice from the older men and through his his pain & dispair, encouraged himself by deciding he would never listen to their type again. The cyclist felt skrewed over, yet through his will & determination, by rationing water & mentally choosing to cycle for each hill one at a time, he endured his physicall, emotional & mental trials and lived to learn the valuable lesson of never consulting old “ codgers” on mapping issues, because their information would most likely be out datted."	3	3		3																					
6269	3	The whys  the  setting  affected  the  cyclist  is  that  the  hotter  it  was  the  more  water  that  he  drank.  Also the further he  travled  the  more  tired  he  got  which caused him to get hotter  and  which  caused  him  to  drink  more  of his water.	1	1		1

At first he seemed at case talking about the cool pines and rushing rivers he was going to encounter once getting to Yosemite. After a strenuous ride he started to get nervous and wonder if he was even going to survive. He was running out of water and he thought be a diamondback. Once he reached the rolling hills he saw a posted speed limit sign saying not to exceed the speed limit of 55 m.p.h. He was doing a ''water depleting 12 m.p.h. wonder how he was going to survive. At the end of the rolling hills he came to an old Welch’s grape factory wondering his life was so cruel. After that he was determined to survive and make it to his destination.

The cyclist listened to the old men so therefour he traveled a good distance. So that made matters bad. With having lack of water with such distance to go the cyclist stuck pebbles in his mouth hoping to forget about his thirst. The cyclist thought of him dying and the birds picking him clean, because he thought he would die because dehydration. The conditions of the road made it harder, First he started with nothing but straight roads then ended up going up and down hill. In conclusion, the cyclist hit many obstacles that made his trip harder then what he thought."	2	2		2																					
6273	3	"The features of setting affects the cyclist because the setting then you won’t had, lots on hills. Also there was no water. For example, in the story He says in was were hilly area.

It said ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war."" This affected the cyclist because he was running out water. Another feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heatstrokes, and not a single car or building the whole way. "	1	1		1																					
6275	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because of the bad conditions of the road and the not sun and the desserts and the low amount of energy supply he had left the reasons why  	1	1		1																					
6276	3	"As if along bike ride through the city isn’t grueling enough, the author of this story had it much worse. First the climate was a recipe for a disaster. “High deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 is clearly a debilitating factor as is direct sunlight and humidity. If the cyclist did not have the proper gean he could be hurt by all three of these factors. Secondly, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS2 his endurance is being tested because it is going for tolerance energy and will power to climb each individual hill. Most importantly, with his lack of water in his bottles, all of these characteristics were harmful. Within a desert, water is to be found nowhere. In hot weather, the water bottles will turn warm and in sunlight, water could even evaporate. To me, it seems like the setting and the weather were the perfect combination for doing much more harm than good."	3	2		3																					
6277	3	The features that affect the cyclist is the lack of water he slows. Another is the directions from the old men that probably aren’t up to date nowadays.	1	1		1																					
6278	3	"The setting explains an early summer evening with some eccentric men. The mood that he would be in would probably be lively. “Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice…” (Kurmaskie) says that if you were very lively, I would take that as a way of being drunk without being drunk, and doing whatever someone thinks you should do without knowing you are being persuaded to do it."	1	1		1																					
6279	3	"The setting causes difficult problems for the cyclist and tough hazards. The weather is hot and just going through hot weather is tough enough, but giving through a desert with limited water had to be miserable. The warmth of the desert had an affect on the cyclist and caused him to be fatigue. This delayed him from getting to his destination quicker as well. Not only did he have to through tough weather but hazardous condition too. There were times when “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake”. This delayed him and took time to cycle around. As you can see this was a difficult journey for the reader and the affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6280	3	"The features surrounding the cyclist effect him greatly. All he has around him are hills, rough terraine, sand + tumble weeds. These features leave him thinking he will die because there is no life around him. Everything is dry + vivid + thats how it makes him feel. The old, rusty water pump shows that it hasn’t been used in ages + the black tar pumped out is no help to his negative thought of life."	3	3		3																					
6281	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Ranging from temperature, surroundings, and the availability of water. First of all, the cyclist felt tired and exhausted because of the temperature and terrain, For example, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I can imagine the cruelty of the heat beating down on him while riding down the roads. It would make me tired and exhausted also. Second of all, the surroundings as he rode affected him and made him have less confidence as he rode further. For example, “This place might have been a thriving little spetatore time say, before the last world war-last on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” It shows how the information he had been giving caused him to feel unsure of where he was going. I’d feel uncapable and would do the same in his situation. Lastly, the lack of water made him scared. For example, “conserve my water and go instead for an hour or so a lest of my inner spirit.” It made him think the situation wasn’t good.

Also, on this short cut he almost runs out of water. The essay ststed I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or se – a test of my inner spirit. He is running out of water but has the determination to get to @CAPS1 last the terrain affects him. The Hills prove to be a challenge with a limited supply of water. The essay states. Flat roads were upleed by sheed, rolling hills. This shows he is extremely determined. Even though the hills added to the struggle he made it through. That is how the author used features of the setting to add to the struggle of the cyclist."	3	3		3

He made an attempt to get the water from the pumps and it was hot and “tested like battery acid”. As he rode on, his confidence only faded more. He travelled through the desert and “ridiculously large snake” and was running low on water. Finally he saw a building in the distance, which ironically enlights was an abandoned juice factory a sign featuring a left sipping on some succulent icy liquid teased ruin, and he began to lose hope.

For example, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularlyand I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This is showing you an image of just how hot the climate he is in. Finally, a lack of water can cause major problems, such as heatstroke or dehydration, yoth which can lead to death.

One example of this is when the character got to a place where there was nothing. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me”. This quote explains that the character (cyclist) was confused. Another example of this harsh setting is when the water in his bottle feels @NUM1 degrees. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” That quote suggests that it is hot outside, which would make the water hot. Another example of the setting is when the terrain changed. ""@CAPS1 road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This made the biker have to work harder, and use more energy.

For starters it says he was “traveling through the high desserts” which is never a safe thing. He had been drinking he water regularly but the temperature was rising. He was, “trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state.” From lack of water because the terrain had altered his water into “A far like substance” The setting of the story was cruel to the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6289	3	"The conditions and features affect everything about the cyclist. The conditions were that, he had to save as much water as possible and keep himself hydrated at the same time so that he wouldn’t dehydrate himself.The features of the desert like land were fierce. It was dry and bumpy, not to mention that there were creatures such as snakes on the prowl out there. You can never predict what they’ll do."	2	1		2																					
6290	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist in many ways. For example when he arrived to the first town the water had tasted like battery acid which made the rider concerve water another is with the harsh conditions such as the temperature. The ride would listen to the old people to try to get to the place he was going faster.	1	1		1																					
6291	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. One feature would be the dryness of the land. He was pedaling for such a long time that he became dehydrated, yet there was not a drop of water for he did not know how long and he didn’t think he could make it that far. Another feature of the setting was the heat. He felt like he could not go on because the heat from the sun made him want to have a heat stroke. Clearly, the features of the setting did greatly impact the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6292	3	"During the cyclist’s trip, he experienced physical and mental strain. The intense heat, rough terrain, the animals and his isolation all contributed to his strain while completing his challenging task. His isolation while cycling down the “shortcut” was a definite factor in his strain. @PERSON1 stated that, “ there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” All @PERSON1 had to focus on was accomplishing his task. There wasn’t anybody nearby to help him and there wasn’t any shelter for him to take to escape the heat. The heat itself played a very predominant factor in Kurmaskie’s physical strain. The heat caused him to become dangerously thirsty and required him to find an abundance of water fast. Kurmaskie stated, “ the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” This statement proves that the intense temperature was a life threatening factor. The rough terrain and snake and two factors in his trip that just helped make his journey even more cruel. The physical strain of avoiding a snake in the middle of the road and the dangerous terrain just put him in a more grading position. "	3	2		3																					
6293	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie’s, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. First of all, the cyclist is dehydrated from the heat and lack of water. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""This sentence from the text stores he is dehydrated, because of this it creates an obstacle he must face. Also, another bad affect from the features of the setting the cyclist is facing is, the rough road ahead he had to face. “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXcEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” If I were the cyclist gazing at the sign I would die just knowing there was trouble up ahead. Luckily the cyclist made his way through and managed his obstacles well."	2	1		2																					
6294	3	"There are many features in the setting that will affect the cyclists. One feature is the climate. When you are cycling and it is really hot you can dehydrate very fast. If it is really cold it is harder to breath and catch your breath. Another feature in the setting that can affect a cyclist is the terrain. If there are too many hills that are really steep than you will get very tired quickly and when it is rocky you have a posablity to fall off the bike and hurt yourself. Last feature in the setting that will affect a cyclist is how isolated the road is. If a cyclist runs out of water and there are no places to stop on the road, this could be almost deadly to a cyclist. Also if the road is so isolated and you get hurt who would find you. This is another deadly situation. These are the main features in the setting that can affect the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6295	3	"The features at the setting affected the cyclist by dehydrating him. The setting had a hot sun, no trees, and no water. The cyclist was also feeling lesy. In the story he said “I and the growing ??? :??? That I could drop from heat stroke.”"	1	2		2																					
6296	3	"The setting was hot and dry, which affected the cyclist greatly. She didn’t have enough space to carry a lot of water and rod to make portrons to drink. Also listening to old guys who didn’t know much didn’t help either and sent her on a much harder path to travel"	0	0		0																					
6297	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. The first was the cool forested road that he set out on. Since the rote not easy, he felt confident and started end in the wrong direction. Another factor was when he rode into the desert. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated and whats little water he could find tasted like battery acid. These factors affected the cyclist by giving him false hope and nearly lead him to his death."	1	1		1																					
6298	3	The way the setting of the story help the guy out alot. He was riding and it was hot but with “cool pines and risum river” it was worth the ride. It keep him cool so he could get his weter in the nex town. That is why I think that the pin and river were a big help.	1	1		1																					
6299	3	"Whether the lack of water, the hills, the tumble weeds – all are things that affect the cyclist. The lack of water affects the cyclist because it is hot outside and he needs water. The hills also affect him because it is hard to peddle up hills. Finally is the tumbleweeds. The tumble weeds show a distinct desert look. When he sees tumble weeds he try’s to keep balance because he is partially dehydrated and doesn’t want to crash. The dehydration / lack of water affect the author because he is very thirsty and everyone needs water to survive. When you are lack of water and energy it makes your goal more hard to complete.  "	2	2		2																					
6300	3	"In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist by gradually wearing him out and pushing his limits of hope and survival skills. At first, the cyclist enters a deserted town but he remains calm and amused by this in the sentence, “I chuckled, check my water supply, and moved @NUM1). Soon after, the cyclist is troubled by a “ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, through the high deserts of California in June” (@NUM2). He is agitated by this, makes a significant dent in his water supply, and unfortunately continues. At the point where he is still isolated and lost beyond repair, the cyclist tries to stay hopeful but soon breaksdown. He reflects, “Telling myself that of I could make it that far, I’d be @NUM3). The features of the setting become more and more disappointed at each leg of the journey for the cyclist."	3	3		3																					
6301	3	"In the beginning of the cyclists journey, he is very happy and carefree. The cyclist comes to the first deserted town the setting isn’t described because the cyclist is not worried yet. After leaving the first town the cyclist barely noticed the heat because, “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” The cyclist still has high spirits. The cyclist begins to get thirsty when he comes upon a water pump. He attempts to get water but the pump isn’t in working condition. Until this point in the story to road has been mostly flat and straight. Then the cyclist notices that the road has some hills in it. At this point the cyclist has no water and is very dehydrated. After one hill the cyclist sees a building. The building is an abandoned grape juice factory, which is ironic considering the state the cyclist is in. The cyclist sucks on rocks as a last resort and gives up hope of living , when he comes upon a fish camp. He gets water from the bathroom and all is well. The setting in this story affects the cyclist because as the setting changes, so do the cyclist moods and feelings about survival and the danger he is in."	3	3		3																					
6302	3	"The feature of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When in the essay it states, “The sun was beginning to beat down” This shows that this affects how he feels when he is cycling through the road and this can affect his ability to keep cycling while the sun ??? him hard. Also when he states “I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph,” this shows he was also dehydrated once goin, very slow because of the ammount of heat and lack of water that affected his ability to keep cycling in the area."	2	2		2																					
6303	3	"I believe the cyclist is a alone, and I think the old man should have shot him. I believe a bike ride that long is a little retarded. I feel that no matter how great or horrible the shape your in you should even go on a realling long rider on a bicycle."	1	1		1																					
6304	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a big way during his journey. The temperature being so hot tired the cyclist and made him thirsty. Also the hills being so high to ride up made it hard to continue. Since he was in the desert there were not many towns to go to. All these factors affected the cyclist on his journey.	1	1		1																					
6305	3	"The setting it the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” in three ways. One way is that it is very baren so there is no shade to stop the sun that is beating down the the cyclist body which adds to his dehydration and lack of to focus. Another way the setting affects the cyclist is the terrain the rolling hills, and desert he bikes through the hills make him work harder using up more energy and exsusaing his ater supply the desert also with it enemies heat make his not trust himself thinks there mirages he sees. The last way it affects him is the ghost towns when he sees them he get a hope of relief that he might get water and out the heat but when he passes in he finds nothing and leaves him chrested and think of death."	3	2		3																					
6306	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because, it is hot, and dry in the California desert when you are on a bicycle, hot and dry with bad directions, and in a desert is bad. It was a long distance ride, in the burning hot sun, with little water, and he thought he was going to die because there was nothing insight. "	1	1		1																					
6307	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more ways than one. For example in the short story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist had to endure going over big dirk hills while being dehydrated and tired from biking miles and miles to get to a destination. The setting can sometimes even cause you to lose hope and give up. The cyclist in the short story; started to lose hope until he found a store that sold fishing bait. The setting controls how long it takes you to getts your destination and how you get there. For example, if you come across a dirt road and theres a big boulder in the way, you have to find another way to get there. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways."	2	2		2																					
6308	3	"The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the California desert in June without water. He is also cycling up and down curry, hilly back roads. The cyclist eventually starts to lose water and his determination is tested as he struggles to get to the next town. He says “wide rings of dried sweet circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some old gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades. Caused me to lough.” The author is showing how the circumstances he is in are taking a toll on him. He also states a road sign “Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This is ironic because he is already exhausted and now he is about to encounter a treachorous stretch of road. I have never cycled for long periods of time and can hardly imagine being pushed to such a state of exhaustion. I can relate it to a time I was played @NUM1 soccer games during the summer heat. It was painful and everytime I received the ball it took all I had to tack it."	3	3		3																					
6309	3	In the story the features of the setting effect him because he was running out of water. He also had to manuver around a snake. It made him tired and dehydratied. His muscles got sore from the rough terrain. He got dehydratied from the sun.	1	1		1																					
6310	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways because it’s almost like the background and theme of the cyclist The features used in this story are mostly about the background in which he is going and the sites of where he is. He’s showing the reader of how much he needs somewhere to go and also now much he’s indespair at the time. When he says “It was sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” In this quote he is saying that he @MONTH1 be tired and physically not be in his best shape but atleast he knows he’s not in a good shape and he knows he’s in trouble, but he can still laugh it off and aware but he keeps trying anyways. This text in my opinion is showing many different ideas such as hope, awareness, and ability and courage to realize you need help but go on anyways to prove to yourself you can finish what you wanted and planned to do."	2	3		3																					
6311	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is a dessert. The dessert is very hot. I know this because in the story, he states that it feels around @NUM1 degrees. He struggled for water but couldn’t find any that was cool. He found a water pump that had ""a tar like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This means it was hot and couldn’t find water."	2	2		2																					
6312	3	Many hazards and rigorous features affect the cyclist. He starts off his journey with the advice of a short cut from old men. The cyclist is very excited about the thought of a short cut and is drinking his water effectliy. Soon he begins to run lost and the sun begins to beat down on him. He take pressure in thinking about the cool stress of @CAPS1 and is then not bothered by the sun even the imaginary setting of fictious stream had an effect on the cyclist. Soon the sun starts to beat on him even more. The cyclist starts to run out of water and he makes sure the vivid he comes across is not a mirage. When he come over the bend he cave to his troubles road and thirst	1	2		2																					
6313	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist persevered through the rough terrain which caused him to become weak. For example, the author states “looked the majority of the pavement in front of me and ceased past tilling to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This shows the author is dehydrated because it is so hot and he kept going even with a physical obstacle. Another thing that affected the author was that he felt like giving up because the terrain was too harsh. For instance in the text, “it didn’t really matter I was going to die and the birds will pick me cleary waveng only some experience outdoor gears.” This shows that the author still had to go even when time get tough. The text shows how exhausted he is by the winds eating at him when he dies. He would dehydrate to the humidity of the desert and heat. In other words, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways."	3	2		3																					
6314	3	The features of the setting affect cyclist because if you are going down hil and then hit a rough road you not going to do so good. Like for example he had been going on flat land then it changed to hills lastly into rough road. These conditions could seriously hurt someone.	1	1		1																					
6315	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a couple different ways. When the cyclist found the gohst town since no one was there he could not ask someone for better directions or get some food or water. The short rolling hills make it harder to pedal because it is hard to pedal uphill. At the end of the story he found a bait shop where he got water and better direction's.	1	2		2																					
6316	3	"The features of the setting affects the setting by all the big hills, and all the roughness of the roads. As the essay says ''flatroad was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I crested the first few of these a large highway sigh jumped out at me,” prety much what it is saying is the flat road soon turned into rolling hills. If I was the cyclist riding up the hills my legs would get very tired and sore after a while one example, is when my friend ,@PERSON1, and I went  bike riding, we went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, in fechmisburg, and we had to ride up a big hill, so after a few pedals our legs started hurting, so we decided to just walk go the hill."	1	1		1																					
6317	3	"There are many ways in which the setting of “Rough Road ahead” affects the cyclist. First of all, he is bicycling through the desert. This poses a problem because it is very dry and hot. At one point in the story, the author writes that he was “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” It is obvious here that lack of water is affecting his in a big way. He almost collapsed because he is so thirsty. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is that he is in a very remote area. He says that “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Since there was rolling now, the cyclist had to keep cycling and drinking his water until he could find a place to stop. Lastly, the “rough road” affected the cyclist. The road made traveling even harder to do and caused the cyclist to have a very rough time. If I had to bicycle for a long period of time, I would much rather have a smooth road so I could renew my energy. The heat, remotness of the area, and the rough road all affected the cyclist on his journey. "	2	1		2																					
6318	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly in the story. The list desert climate tales damage onto the cyclist by quickly depleting his water supply. He also began to get worried when every town the old men told about turned out to be a ghost town. This crawled doubt in the cyclist mind that he might not survive the “shortcut” told off by the old men.  	1	1		1																					
6319	3	The features in the setting effects the cyclist because there it different kinds of hills. He has watch out for rocks in the middle of the road. He has to make sure he has a lot of water because it looks like he is in the desert. There is no cars around but he still has to look for any cars in case they came out of nowhere. There is a lot of turns. It is very hot so he has to make sure he does not have a neat scaoke. There is no places where he can stop because there is no shade. There is no stores where he can stop & get water and food at either. That is the setting of the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
6320	3	"@CAPS1   the  story  the  condition of  problem  often effected the mood of the cyclist . For  example when the sign said ,â€ Rough road ahead: Do not exceed  posted speed limit.â€ @CAPS1  this time he saw a snake he was scared so he eased  past trying to keep balance while he was  dehydrated . The dry and hot climate began to become problem for the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6321	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he could have tried  if he drunk the battery taste water. or if he didn’t get enough clean water on time. Driving a bike on in a long distance, with no water or any other supples is very energy consuming. So you have to plan trips like that very wisly.  "	1	1		1																					
6322	3	"In the story, the setting greatly affects the cyclist. The cyclist, pedaling through California, is obviously very hot in the “beautiful @DATE1.” He also runs out of water, which nearly dooms him. But that’s not the worst of it. The hills make him run out of water and energy even quicker. There are also no places to stop for water. The cyclist is lucky he survived the rugged terrain of California."	2	2		2																					
6323	3	The features of the setting afect the cyclist in many ways. If he wasn’t in “High deserts of California in June” he probaly wouldn’t be dehydrated if he was in @DATE1 it wouldn’t be so hot out.

6325	3	"In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit,” the featurs of the setting had a great deal to do with the cyclist. The rodes were bumpy, windy, and many hills.

6327	3	"In the story, the cyclist starts out with a lot of confidence that he can complete the whole ride. But after he left first town he had been riding and needed water, so he stoped at a fork in the road he had just to;to get water from a pump which tastes like battery acid. Then as he progressed further in his trip he came to a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed speed limit”(Joe Kurmaskie pg @NUM1) This part of his trip made it very challenging by making him face rough roads and mountains that he had to cross which sucked the water out of him. Then as  he came over the last mountain, he saw a sign for a gart store. So when he arrived he got some water and got directions for a man who had the best map. So you can see that going over an the mountains, sucks all the water out of the cyclist, so he was so relieved when he got the water at the end."	2	2		2

He is dehydrated and exhausted due to the conditions of the environment he was in. the cyclist became dehydrated because of not only a lack of water, but also the scorching heat of the desert. He sweat to much to the point that he lost an enormous amount of bodily fluids. The cyclist also was traveling on unpaved road which required more energy than traveling on one that is paved. Therefore the cyclist became so exausted that he almost died. These are the ways the environment the cyclist was in affected him."	2	2		2																					
6329	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in ways of feeling doubtful, confidence, determination and relief. For example he feels doubtful when he has hardly any water and has no clue where he is or where he is going to end up. He first felt confident when the old people on the porch told him how to go and then at the end when he says he will listen to his map next time. He was also was determined because he wanted to get to the next town which he does, that also makes him relived, and wants to get to Yosemite National Park. That is how the setting affects the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6330	3	"The features of the setting in which the cyclist is in change his outlook on the trip. When he first begins his trip, the road is fine, so he becomes confident. When the terrain began to change, he writes, “sometimes life can feel so cruel”, he grows despairing as he faces new terrain with so little water. When he begins to see a building, he becomes hopeful and determined. However, when he realizes its old juice factory, he grows bitter. When he leaves the factory, he feels ??? all hope. The comparison can be shown when he writes, “somehow i climbed away from the abandoned factory of of juice and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope."" @CAPS1 the end, when he is revived with water he almost looks back on the journey comically.

The terrain went from being flat, to short rolling hills. The road had been abandoned along with the town he had passed through, hoping to get water. The man goes can to say, “ I toiled on, at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me ""(Rough Road Ahead).

Cycling is a vigorous exercise and can take much strength out of a rider. Water is neccesary to make sure the cyclist stays hydrated. In the text, the old men had the cyclist take a detour through desert areas and hilly terains. Because of the hot weather and rough roads the cyclist became dehydrated faster than normal.

For example, “The sun was beginning to beat down.” they were starting to get hot, than tired. Than when he came to all the bumps in the road, It was harder to pedal. He was also drinking his bottle of water hard. So that means he's hot getting tired and lost “I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength” That is telling us he’s working too hard, than he’ll be worn out to ride. Those are reason's why features affected the cyclist. "	2	2		2																					
6342	3	"First, the old men affect the cyclist by throwing him off track. They do this by telling him of a “shortcut” that will take him right to his destination. Then the cyclist was faced with rough rolling hills of a highway. Over his long journey the cyclist still remained determined to reach his destination."	1	1		1																					
6343	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. If the cyclist was riding his bike in @LOCATION1 in he middle of June he wouldn’t of gotten so dehydrated. This biker is riding in the high deserts of California that reach to @NUM1° degrees. In the middle of @DATE2 in @CAPS1.A it bearly reaches @NUM2° degrees. Also the desert is know to have nothing. If he was riding somewhere else every mile there could be a gas station. Although this cyclist is riding in “No @CAPS2’s @CAPS3”. Lastly the roads in the desert are a lot more dangerous, since people never really drive through, no one really comblains regularly about pot holes and stuff. They are more worried about the cities were many people travel, there is no point to change or fill pot holes where no one really travels."	1	1		1																					
6344	3	"The setting really takes determination away from the cyclist. The were hills that made his ride difficult. It says, “over one long cripping hill, a bulding came into view.” This shows the hills were hard on him because he says they were long and crippling. Another thing in the setting was the building. He was extremely thirsty and becomes he to an abandoned grape juice factory it said, ''by the looks of a had beth a @CAPS1 Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant.” These were two of several examples of the setting affecting the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6345	3	"The features of the setting have a major affect on the cyclist. It is a very hot day and he is in a desert in California with a limited water supply. It starts becoming very hot, and his water supply begins to decrease quickly. The old men who he says “have not left their porch since @PERSON1 was in office” gave him very wrong directions to Yosemite and he ended up getting lost out in a hot California desert. He eventually came to a fishing store where he refreshed with alot o f water from the sink, and then was off again on his way to Yosemite."	2	2		2																					
6346	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclists in a big way because roads had bottles in then that could have caused him to get really hurt. Also, the water he was drinking was streaming and tasted like battery acid. Then came some rolling hills which would be another big challenge for him. The setting was pretty baron for the cyclist because he also come across a snake. Last, he thought he saw some mirages that tells me that the climate is extreme for the cyclists. That’s how the setting affects the cyclists."	1	2		2																					
6347	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist for a few reasons. One reason is that it makes it easier to picture how the cyclist feels. Also it makes the cyclist seem a bit insane for doing what he’s doing in weather that he could, “drop from heatstroke.” @CAPS1 reason is that the weather is affecting the cyclist so bad that he’s seeing a mirage of a “building-abandoned years ealier.” The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the conditions seem impossible to make it in."	2	3		3																					
6348	3	"Throughout the story, the cyclist describes the hot weather and harsh tarrens of the midwest in his quest to find a source of water. He notes several times about the nice @DATE1, which ear him, quickly warms into sweltering heat as he pedals along. He also goes into detail about the change from flat ground to rolling hills on his journey. Behind these aspects make the use frol final much inorder  for the cyclist and gives the reader image as what he is going through."	1	1		1																					
6349	3	"In the article “Do not exceed the posted speed limit,” the features of the setting took toll on the cyclist in many ways. First off the whole Setting was a dry, dusty not desert that would chair anybody. “The sun was beginning to beat down, but i borely noticed it.” The own affected the cyclist by dehydrating him so much, which bring me to the next point. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and i was traveling through the high deserts of california in June. This caused him to become even more dehydrated, resulting in him thinking he was going to die. Along the way he found an old abandoned juice factory. This affected him by filling him with despair and hopelessness, causing him to push more and more to reach water. In the end the feature of the setting only made him more determined to reach water."	3	3		3																					
6350	3	"The setting affected the cyclist in many ways, One way was the weather. In the story it said “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (kermaskie @NUM1). Thats quote said he is in a desert and desert are usally warm. It also said in June and June is usally a hot temp month. The weath affected the cyclist because it was hot and he started to become dehydrated and had little water. Another way the setting affected the cyclist was the souroundings. In the story it said. “There was no one in sight not a building, car or structure of any kind “(kurmaskie). That saying there know one around to help him so if he gets hurt or something. Also theres no where to get some water."	2	1		2																					
6351	3	"Many of the features of the setting effect the cyclist. The most obvious and direct feature would be that this adventure took place in the “high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 about that passage says blistering heat; high meaning its going to be closer to sun, deserts, where the world is hot, California, which is known to be smoggy, and June, which is the middle of summer. Also, the closet water supply was “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,” there was a “long crippling hill” all while the sun was heating down.  All of that would most obviously effect the cyclists by making him tired, which he vividly explains by expressing his fears of losing conscionous."	2	3		3																					
6352	3	"In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is when the cyclist says “I noticed the terrain changing, Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” This effects the cyclist because it makes him work harded when he is dying of thirst. Especially on a hot summer day. It makes his muscles work harder and use his strength more. In the summer time it is extremely hot. When the cyclist is biking it is very hot, he says”… in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” After this quote he is explaining the difficulty of getting flustrated an there’s No cold water. This affects the cyclist to think about water and not bothering to think about where he is at he could be lost. He didn’t have a good map."	2	2		2																					
6353	3	"As the cyclist goes on his trip, he is met with many dreary places and people. For starters, the old men he knew he shouldn’t have trusted but did any way. This led him through the desert. Even in a car the desert can be a very despairing place. On a bicycle it must be even worse knowing that if you run out of water op one will be there to save you from dehydration. Just the endlessly bleak landscapes also played a roll in the cyclist feelings. Another bad feature is the endless amount of abandonment towns and spoiled water. Every time he thought he was saved he was put down again by that fact. For example he had to pump for minutes only to get bad tasting water. Finally just when his strength was to give out he found the bait place & water and that dramatically and a place to rest too bad there was another old man there, isn’t it?! "	2	3		3																					
6354	3	IIn the essay the features of the cycleist affect the setting because the readers wouldnt have thought that he was in that bad of danger if he hadnt of been going through the desert. When the cyclist got to the grape factory he stated that he was almost dehydrated. And then when he got to the bait shop he drank from the faucet.	1	1		1																					
6355	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by their were rolling hills that went up and down and it to alot of streanth and also he barely had water because, it was so hot he kept drinking and ran out of water early. In the story it say when he was riding that “ He barely noticed that the sun was starting to beat down.” This quote shows it was starting to get hot. Also, in the story he says “ I checked my water supply.” @CAPS1 means he’s starting to realize his waters running short. So in all the setting is hot abandoned and theirs no water source, so  the cyclist is being affected by all of this"	2	2		2																					
6356	3	"SETTING WAS A IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE STORY. I WAS A DESSERT IN A DESSERT THERE IS A LACK OF WATER. AND ME WAS IN A BIKE THAT IS DANGEROUS. BECAUSE YOU ARE USING YOUR FEET TO MOVE WHICH TAKES OUT ENERGY, AND USES WATER FROM YOUR BODY."	1	1		1																					
6357	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was biking up hills in extreme heat. He also had a short water supplyl while head in the wrong direction.	2	2		2																					
6358	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The directions given to the cyclist by the elderly was incorrect and he got lost. The lack of water led to the possibility to sucking pebbles to forget about his thirst. The rolling hills caused the cyclist to use more energy.These were the affects the setting had to the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
6359	3	"The feachers of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. When she biked around a bend, “my troubles, thirsts, and fear were all behind me.”"	1	1		1																					
6360	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, A cyclist set out on a bike ride in the heat of summer in California where he will staying he met some old people who gave him a “short cut”. As he forms out most of the places he was told about were abandoned ghost towns without a single drop of drinkable water. If he were in a different setting like by a river or spring he would just stop and drink from that. Or even if he was in a more populated, industriated area he could stop in any building and ask for a drink; But he was in the dry, hot, abadond hills of California without any water. Under these conditions he grew tired, thirsty; dehydrated; and desperate for a drink finally he came apon a bait shop that had water there"	2	2		2																					
6361	3	"Durring the cyclist @CAPS1 he was affected by the setting frequently. When he was cycling it be came very hott to him but at first it wasn’t so bad. “The sun was begining to beat dow, but I barely Noticed it.” This proves that the cyclist knows it was getting hot but it did not affect him. Another thing that affected him was the time that he was travling in. “I had been hitting my water bottles pritty regularly and I was travling through the high dezerts in califonia in June.” This proves that the reader was constantly drinking because of the time of day and year he was out. All of this shows that the setting affected the cyclist on his @CAPS2. "	2	2		2																					
6362	3	"I think that the features of the setting really do affect the way someone rides a bike because certain places have certain terrain. Some types are not always good for a bike rider because if it’s bumpy then someone could fall off the bike. Also, if it is dark you @MONTH1 not even be able to see where you are going then you could hurt your-self very seriously. That’s why riding a bike is dangerous. Also, if your in the type of enviroment where every thing is smooth then you @MONTH1 be able to have a nice bike ride.  "	1	1		1																					
6363	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in, “Do not Exceed posted speed Limit.” By changing him physically. He was in the California desert in the middle of June without any water left. This was taking a physical toll on him. His physical effect was making him feel hopeless as well. He says, “It was a sad hopeless laugh mind you, but at least l still had the energy to feel sorry for myself."" So the way he was suffering from dehydration physically effected his emotional state because he felt as though there was nothing he could do. Had he been in another place, for example @LOCATION2, where it does not get newly a shot as soo thon California, he would not have been suffering from dehydration, as have been in such an isolated place. His cycling could be compared to the climbers who were lost in the snow storm in @LOCATION3. Instead of dehydration and heat strone, however they suffered from hypothermia. Had they been on a different mountain, there would have been no snow storm and they would be fine. The outcome of this story and the climbers was determined by their setting."	3	2		3																					
6364	3	The conditions gave the cyclist no hope at some points because the heat of the land the of the features of the setting were so harsh he had no hope like when the cyclist says I hope I make It to the horizon because theres nothing else to compare. He can’t say lets ride to the next building or mail box because there are none. The desert features make the cyclist fell that its just him no one can help him he’ll die of dyhydration. Then the features get worse he sees the welchs grape fruit building giving him little hope of survival then he finds out that its deserted and that’s like the final thing he gives up. The cyclist almost unconscious then runs into the fishing store where he has a sip of water. So the features were the main reason the cyclist lost hope.	2	3		3																					
6365	3	"The features of setting affect the author because it moves him dehydrated. The dessert sun look sweat out of him and he had no water to bring that would replace his electrolites . Also, once the author had got into the hills he had lost a lot of his energy so peddling up his was a lot of work. If I were the author I would also have gotten tired because you need water in your body to survive."	1	2		2																					
6366	3	"The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist greatly. In the cyclists opinion things began pretty well. He had a positive attitude as it states “with strong legs and a smile on my face.” As the man moves on he comes to a fort of sorts. To him, the sight was troubling. Though troubling, he still had the confidence that he could continue. Next he noticed the changes in the terrain. He explained “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This means that he would have to peddle harder and with greater force in order to get over the hills. The weather was not and the cyclist was running out of water. The possibility of heatstroke came to mind. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind”, as told by the man. His mind entered a state of sad, and hopeless thoughts, but he persevered and cycled on. At this point he was very thirsty and felt his death was near. He said “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean” As he kept going he spotted an old guy in sight. He regained hope and moved ahead. The features of this story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. Physically he was tired and worn out. A like this horrible state, mentally he was becoming negative and pessamistic about his travel. The setting's features interfered with the cyclist's physical and mental state."	3	3		3																					
6367	3	"In this story, “No Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, by be Joe Kurmaskie I believe the setting greatly affect the cyclist. I believe this because when it’s long downhill cool roads is fine but if it is straight uphill roads and extremely hot he feels like he can’t keep pedaling. The cyclist gets very weary when the setting is out in the hot desert with no one around so the setting has a huge affect on the mood in this story. Another example"	2	2		2																					
6368	3	"A cyclist is a bike rider. They can be in groups of diffrent people or they can be a solo cyclist. Some cyclist go for a few miles riding there bikes some can go for more like @NUM1 miles, some go over hills, go trow water they do alot with what they do. They have alot of time on there hards to ride a bike that far."	1	1		1																					
6369	3	"The setting is hot like desert, no one around, and very dry. Being hot outside affects the cyclist because he is sweaty and needs water. The heat wears him down. Having no one around causes him to not get water which he needs for his journey. These things make him week and makes it harder for him to find a place to get water."	1	1		1

6371	3	"In this narritive of a cyclist, riding in california, and handed for Yosemite national park, he encounters a lack of water and bad directions from a group of old men on a pourch. The setting plays a big part in his ""challenge"", from the pine trees to the barren hills. In the begining of his trie he passes a ""gbost town"" that has clearly seen better days. This presents him with his first doubt and he continues with caution. Then the pines that, ""had my name written all over them."" This gives him hope and reassurance. Then the rusty pump and ""ramshackle shed."" They took the hope and reasurance away, making him cautrous. The hills that made him work hard to get over, the snake that slowed him down and the whelches juice company that was abundanded all didn't help and made matters worse. Then he got some water at a bathroom and it was all better. It the setting has less the same the whole way he wouldn't have had any hope or he would have hope but it wouldn't fall and rise, making the story interenting.   "	3	3		3																					
6372	3	"Winding hills limited water and poor directions are the troubles of this cyclist. First he gets very bad directions from a group of old men that have not been outside of their porch in awile, then he gos through the first town and does not fill is water bottles then he gets lost and runs out of water but finds a fishing store where there is water and people that give him a better map."	2	1		2																					
6373	3	"No water, and no direction effects the cyclist. Water effect cyclist because he said in the essay “I could drop from heatstroke"" (Kurmaskie). also no direction is another big one. It is important because without direction he is going to rideing for a long time. In conclusion water and no direction was the cyclist problem in the story"	2	1		2																					
6374	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he thought he packed enough water so he began on his way he drank most of his water less than half way to his destination. He didn’t realize how hot it was until he got down to his last couple of sips of water. He started to become dehydrated he rembered the old men said that the next town was abait eighteen miles away so he kept on going when he reached the town there was nothing to drink just an old run down factory. He took same rocks and sucked on them, he went over a bump had swallowed it. He said to him self next time he would just go by what the map said everything he had gone past on the way had been run down and abandoned. Finaly he reached a bait shop and when inside the bathroom and got some water."	2	2		2																					
6375	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist grate deal. For example, it was not and hill goet dehydrated. He went down this rusty-bumpy road, which didnt help his dehygration And another example would be he found a plane was he could set a change and find the best way to get where he was going. That the features on the setting affection the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6376	3	"The cyclist goes through many natural settings that affect him. First of all he rides into barren land. The cyclist portrayed this barrenness by saying “it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This was in response to the first “town” he came across. Next he speaks of a large snake that came close to him which is dangerous, but luckily he manuvers out of its way. But the worse setting the cyclist had to deal with was the lack of water. This is a threat to any living creature. But in the end he found some water and the story ended fine."	2	2		2																					
6377	3	"In the essay “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting relates to how the author is feeling. At first, when the author sees the abandoned first “town” he is not too worried about it and moves on. “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” The author is okay right @CAPS1, and still has enough water. Next he starts to get low on water, and he becomes more panicked; which in return makes the day seem even hotter. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of california in June.” @CAPS1 that the author is low on water the day seems worse afterward he continues on and runs into a rattlesnake, which makes him even mere panicked “and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balanc in my dehydrated state.” @CAPS2, when he got to the bait store and drank from the sink; things didn’t seem so bad anymore and there was no more talk about water nor the heat. As a result the setting was related to the author’s moods."	3	3		3																					
6378	3	"The features of the setting did affect the cyclist in this small story. In this story the setting is a hot dry terrain which can be better explained by the name California. This heat of the desert climate seems to start have an effect on him about after he reaches the first town. I know this by his statement.”This place might have been a thriving little spot at time –say, before the last war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chucked, checked my water supply and moved on. The the sun was beginning to beat down. The summer heat is thriving how during this @DATE1 and he is drinking lots of water.”So this setting does affect him greatly it causes him to use his water supply and it causes him to begin the process of dehydration. I know how the summer heat can affect you during @DATE1 activity ‘s. At times it feelslike you are going to die but that building is always around the bend just for the cyclist.  "	3	2		3																					
6379	3	"In Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the features of the setting are devastating to the cyclists condition. ""@CAPS1 through the high desert of California"" is surely never an easy task to begin with. Without proper hydration, people often suffer heatstrokes or pass out, sometimes even perishing, it is entirely worse for this cyclist because of the effort he is exerting, pedaling over “short, rolling hills.” Even worse, the trail a few very old, eccentric men set run on doesn’t do much in the way of nuping with a depleted water supply. The first town the cyclist comes across easily splits “the traditional definition of a ghost town” and the only other water pump he comes to emits only sewage and incredibly hot brackish water. Therefore, the heat is only made worse by the look of water on the cyclist path. This combination of features in then setting causes a great deal of distress to the cycling, and almost pushing him to death."	3	2		3																					
6380	3	"There are many ways the setting affected the cyclist in this story like the weather, supply of food and water, wrong estimation for old people and the road. First off the weather was was very dry and it was two hundred degrees, so it made you sweat and hard to breath. The supply of water was harsh not much around at all and when he tryed to get water the pumps would pump out not water. The weather and water supply were two maijor affects on the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6381	3	"In the beginning of the story the author is happy, but towards the end grows upset. ""I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face” (@NUM1). This shows how the author is in a good mood and happy to be there. She is on a journey, and no one can touch her. Then the story takes an unexpected turn. “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,” (@NUM2). After getting lost in a town that seems distant from any living things the author hears people! She is extremely reliefed to have found anyone of help to her. She gets water and is forever greatful. The setting is horrifying to her because you will feel like you cant even if you live there! She felt alone and that she would die. If the setting was in a city surrounded by buildings the author would still feel some security even without water"	3	3		3																					
6382	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The reasons were the water and the hills. One reason was water because his water were cooled down offer he refilled it all the way up. My last reason is because of the rolling hills.	1	1		1																					
6383	3	"There are features such as blazing heat coming off the sun, “short, rolling hills”, and no water. There was also the fact that the rider thought he was in the middle of nowhere. This has a great effect on the cyclist, both physical and emotional. The heat, lack of water and constant up hill riding can take a lot of energy out of someone and make it extremely hard to ride. Not to mention there isn’t much hope left so that eliminates the whole mind over matter thing. All the features of the setting put together can lead to major trouble."	2	2		2																					
6384	3	"Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. After about @NUM1 miles, when in need of water supply the cyclist found a rusty pipe which a tarlike substance came out, then a brackish water substance. While cycling, you are in need of clean water. Next, the terrain changed from being flat to very hilly. In need of water,the last thing you need is be to be challeged more. Later on down the food, there were no cars or any buildings in sile. When you are feeling the the worst, you would want someone to he near in case you fall out, but no one was in site on that road. Lostly, seeing the old welch's Grape Juice Factory would affect the cyclist. Seeing that image of a drink factory right infront of you but not business has to make them fell like he/she will never make it. These features of the setting had to affect the cyclist."	2	3		3																					
6385	3	"The features in the setting dramaticaly affect the cyclist. Everything was fine until he ran out of water and reached the hills. Now if he was in callada he woudn’t of dehydrated. But the hills were sure to play with his mind. The most import setting is the welchs grape juice factory. He would have had all of the grape juice he wanted, but it was abandoned. An ironic twist “as he calls it. And the last one is hte bait shop that sawes his life, where an old man offers him directions."	1	2		2																					
6386	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist because he was in the middle of no-where with no water or direction. The man was also very thirsty and had no water left in his water bottle, he began to get very thirsty. I found an example to show that he was thirsty. “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel”. By saying he was doing @NUM2 when it should have been @NUM1. was saying he was getting very exhausted and he needed water to get him feeling refreshed once again. Also, the fact that there was no one in sight to give him direction effected him too because he didnt know where the next refudge was. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. “ From the mans point of view, he probably thought civilization was many more miles away and he probably could not make it that for. The setting effected him by making him probably begin to stress or panic a lot for the most part."	2	2		2																					
6387	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he feels dehydrated and tired because he is riding through the desert and has a lack of water. I often feel this way when jogging for extended periods of time. The men in the story “who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” also add to the story. Due to their role, the cyclist takes an unmarked shortcut that turns out to be horrible. The Welch’s factory affects the cyclist because it increases his thirst and causes him to once more think about it. The sign showing grape juice looks irrisistable to him and drives him to keep forward in search of anything to drink. The terrain charge also affects the cyclist because it causes him to have to work ever harder to get up hills now rather than just ride flat terrain."	3	3		3																					
6388	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 the heat the cyclist experienced, since he was in a desert in June, made him dehydrate faster. The heat made him drink more so he ran out of water more quickly. Then he would try and conserve water by not drinking and this would cause him to dehydrate more because he was losing body fluid in sweat secondly, in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ”Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” These hills affect the cyclist because he would need to use more energy to cycle up the hills. This would cause him to become exhausted more quickly than he would on flat land. If the setting had been different, such as not being in a hilly desert, the cyclist would not have become as dehydrated and tired as he did. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways."	3	2		3																					
6389	3	"The features of the setting directly affects the cyclist. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This affects the cyclist because in June it is very hot and going through a desert makes it worse, so he would continue to drink water until he has no more. He is also using energy which is making him sweat and drink more water. “One ramshackle shed. Several rusty pipes and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule greeted me.” This could also cause a problem because he can’t renew his water source, which means he has to conserve it, and can’t use as much energy. Both of these things factor into the setting, in a desert with no water, affecting the cyclist more than cycling in a cold day."	2	2		2																					
6390	3	"The cyclist in, “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, was affected greatly by the features of the setting. First of all the weather was extremely hot and hot weather just makes you feel exhausted and like you can’t do anything. Also no one is in sight. She is all alone making her feel small and helpless. I know that when there is no one around I get scared. Finally there is no water around. The author is obviously dieing of thirst and with nothing around her she acts even thirstier."	1	2		2																					
6391	3	"The setting effected the cyclist by the rough roads, the cylist having a hard time pedaling over the roads. The snake, the cyclist got scared of the snake on his ride through the “town.” The fact he was running out of water and the water he found tasted like battery acid. The setting was very rough on the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6392	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him tiered, scared, thirsty and cause him to worry. The setting was a hot California day in June and the cyclist was riding through the heat and over the hills and difficult terrain. The cyclist describes the land when he says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” He also says, “Over one long, crippling hill.” As the cyclist gets further and further, he has more doubt. Fear and thirst start to get to him. He says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” When the cyclist finds the bait shop he has almost lost all hope. On his way to the shop he says, “Slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” At the end, the setting makes the cyclist regain his strength as he sees the bait shop, when he sees it, he says, “Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me.” The features of the setting put the cyclist in an unsteady ride of fear, hope and confidence"	3	3		3

But the only thing is that he didn’t never say anything about getting his bait for the fish.

As for grassy, flowery land its more of a sense rout, and makes you want to keep going and see many things. Hills and terrain make it harder to keep going but more of a chalange, and a good workout at the same time, the setting does affect the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6396	3	"When the cyclist first recieves directions to Yosemite Park from the “old timers” he met, he was pretty confident that they knew what they were talking about. To his dismay, these elderly men sent him through life threatening conditions in a deserted area. As the cyclist begins his journey through the hot, June weather, he “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.'' As he continues forward, he notices that there are no buildings, cars, or people of any kind. He passes abandoned towns and creeps into the desert flat land. The flatland however, morphs into crippling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes awaiting. Not only is the terrain suddenly different, but the cyclist is rapidly deteriorating. Tiredness and lack of water make the cyclist think “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.'' It was amazing that through all this, the cyclist was able to reach a small fishing camp where he is quickly replenished. “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp'' saved the cyclist from almost certain death and him to always just use his map.

For example when the narration says, “At some point, humble weeds crossed my path” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The tone of the cyclists from the quote above shows despare creeping into his mind. Also, another good example is when the narration says, “@CAPS1 hill, a building came into view” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist sounds more hopfull than before.

6400	3	The terrain described in this essay add affect to the strugles of the cyclist. For example when the author says “their were no cars nor buildings in sight” that adds to the affect that he is really out in the middle of nowhere. Also it adds a lot of affect when he comes upon an abandond juice factory and he is so thirsty he puts stones in his mouth to gather saliva. Also when he finally finds water an “oldtimer” asks if he knows the best way to go.	2	2		2

6405	3	"The features affect the cyclist in a big way. For one the ""heat beating down on him made him sweaty, hot and tired. The heat had also made him thirst which led him to drink a lot of water in a little amount of time so he ran out of water before the next town. Also the fact he was in the desert there were no trees to give time off shade that he could rest in. There were also no people around to help him or give him water. So in the ride he struggled more than he thought he could."	2	3		3

If the water has reached such a high temperature, the reader infe that it must be not outside the author implied nthis when he says he is California in June, it is agarsears day, and the sun was beating down. Another aspect of the setting, the lane, dirty, “ghost town” infested land, had a larse affect on the cycle. As he begins to see how hope. He cannot see any signs of madon life; “there was no one is sight, not a building car or structure of any kind. This empty land make the cyclist himself feel empty.

As he reached “the fork of sorts” twenty miles up the road, ""the sight was troubling to him his water supply was somewhat deterriorating, so he became a bit uncered. Finally when the cyclist read the sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the author continued to move on, but with a large chunk of his confidence gone. He was dehydrated, toned, and had lost a lot of hope after coming across all these places. When he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, he was as happy as could be, knowing he would drink some water continue his journey the next day, and not listen to old men’s directions again. Many people in stories or in real life are affected by the setting they are in. In the novel @CAPS1 of champions by @PERSON1, one of the characters named @ORGANIZATION1 went on a journey to find an art exhibition, running into many problem's on the way, which in many cases, gave him a lack of hope in reaching his destination safely."	3	3		3

6412	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the road that he was on. He was on a road that had snakes and that the trees where all on the road. The road was like a snake cause it was waved and it had a hug hill that made you go fast and it was hard to star dark because the hill was stipped and know one would ride that hill by if it was a rash than it would have been easier to ride the hill cause than there will be more people these would be some people that are these that can help you if you get hurt. There is also no lights there or if you ride at night then you can’t see where you are going un less you put a light on you bike or himilet then you can ride easier the hill at night. That light there is the features of the setting that affects the cyclist that is going down a hill that know one is there that can help you if you need the help you can get it.	1	1		1

In conclusion the features of the setting has a huge affect on the cyclist.	2	2		2

Also, “Not the miles into the next section of the ride, he noticed a terrain change.” For example flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills. Then after over coming that, “A large highway sign jumped out at him saying or reading,” “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit. And that was 55.

6417	3	"In the essay intitled “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed the speed limit” the setting changes as so does the mood of @NUM1 essay as well as the mood of the cyclist. For example towards the begining of the essay, at the reserve the essay states, “At a resevoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening.” This shows how towards the begining of the essay the cyclist is happy, just woke up and getting reading to go on a nice bike ride; however this all changes when he gets directions from a cople of “old-timers.” From that point on his trip goes down hill and the essay states, “About forty miles in to the pedal, I arrived at the first “town”, a ghost town,” “The sun was beginning to heat down,” This also shows the the setting of a ghost town and a setting with the sun beating down is effecting the mood of the essay and the mood of the cyclist as well as when he goes another @NUM2 miles to a different ghost town with only a few rusty water pumps containing acid flavored water. At this point cyclist is very worried because its hot and he has no water, while knowing he has another @NUM3 miles to go. @NUM3 miles of rolling hills and hot sun shile seeing a “A Rough Road Ahead” sign and a diamondback snake he is sure he is going to die. However it all changes when a different sign, one for a baitshop. This is how the author, Joe Kurmaskie uses the setting to effect the mood."	3	3		3																					
6418	3	"The dusty, dry setting has a serious effect on the cycling author. It got so long and hot that, “…@CAPS1 blues tune ‘summer time’ rattled around in…my deteriorating brain.” The author has spent so long cycling through heat, his brains starting to shut down. It’s also because there is very little water left for him. Another problem is that every building/town except the last building is deserted. So without any chance of being refueled and restocked, it’s the author v.s nature. Plus, as the author states, the directions came from old people who, “…haven’t left their porches since Carter was in office.” The word has greatly changed. Towns have become deserted, buildings rundown but the roads are kept in shape. The towns the old people mentions are now ghost towns, and are no help to the author. "	2	2		2																					
6419	3	"As the cyclist continues on his ride, changes begin to occur in the surroundings, which ultimately affects the cyclist’s attitude. When first starting out on his journey to Yosemite, the cyclist started out that morning, “with strong legs and a smile on my face”. He had received information from a few of the older locals that would help to cut the amount of time it took to arrive at Yosemite National Park. However, as he was riding, the cyclist realized that perhaps the older men’s travel advice was a little out dated. with barely any water left to hydrate himself, and being surrounded by nothing but more road and desert, the cyclist couldn’t help but laugh. “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. “At this point, the cyclist was mad at himself for not just using the map that he had brought with him instead of listening to the locals. Although the cyclist remained determined to find water, he had begun to lose hope when he suddenly came across a bait store. Here he was able to rehydrate himself, and with his renewed spirit, continued on his journey, this time using his map."	3	3		3

6421	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it just looks like he is on the highway as in the desert riding his motorcycle or bike and it does look like hes coming or going on a vacation and because of the way hes riding it it seems hes going real fast as about to fall.	1	1		1

Also, since the cyclist had no water he was becoming dehydrated. The area he was biking through had barely any people. This means there was no water available for him.

If it would have been Yosemite with cool pines and rivers he would’ve felt completely different. No people in sight lacked security and water, also no buildings.

Actually that made the author scared that maybe he was all alone in the desert with ghost town. The unplanned that the roads were rusty where the speed limit was 55 mph since he barely had any water he was going 12 mph. This tells me, he’s troubled and confused about the surrounding ways, because it all desert seem light it became the author is slowly loosing hope on the travels further and further.

Also, the terrain can affect biker. If one was to ride on a flat terrain is gonna put much wear…and tear on the cyclists body therefore the flat terrain would be easier. All of those reasons explains that the settings affect the cyclist in many  ways."	2	2		2

He thinks that it is a little funny that the old men’s “town” was now abandoned. “…(the town) fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled…” This shows that the author is still in good spirits because he can still laugh. When “a tar like substance  oozed out of the water pump at the next stop the author became a little unsettled, as the author was running low on water. But he was still optomistic. Once the rolling expansive hills came into view, the author  let out a “sad, hopeless laugh.” The author was depressed , dehydrated and had all but given up , however he kept going and eventually made it to some water."	3	3		3

When the cyclist comes for the first abandured “town” he searches for water but finds only that which tastes like battery acid “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” The makes his dehydration seem much worse because of the fact that he has water it is just undrinkable. The rough road ahead there gives the feeling of determination because when the cyclist in on his last legs he must work even harder to get water a flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,” this quote shows that despite his condition the cyclist most perservere. Also quote “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridicuosly large snake –“tumble weeds and snakes give the feeling of desolation and of being alone, which is what the cyclist is this point.

He thought he would be able to stop and get water regulary but as he found out he was in the middle of the desert with no water around. The man pushed himself and stopped thinking about water.

THE LAND WAS MAKING HIM FEEL AS IF HE DIDN’T WANT TO KEEP MOVING ALONG."	2	2		2																					
6448	3	"The setting affected the cyclist greatly. He had no water and he was “traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The deserts and no water could have been life-or-death to him, making him stressed and thirsty. Couple that with him biking, and you have yourself a dehydrated man in the desert! When he was between the “ghost town” and bait shop he says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind, This would make the cyclist think that there is no hope for his survival if he passed out. The deserts of California affects any cyclist greatly especially one without water like the cyclist in the story. "	2	2		2																					
6449	3	It think  it means  to be all you can be.	0	0		0																					
6450	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because of how hot it is, how big the hill is and the shortage of cold water. For example it is so hot that the cyclist does not think he is going to make it. Also all he could do was a water depleting @NUM1. Also the hills became so big he crested the first couple until the sign jumped out saying rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly he had some rough terrain to ride over and no water he was at a dehydrated state and he could only do a water depleting @NUM1 when the speed limit was @NUM3. "	2	2		2																					
6451	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by causing him to become dehidrated and start to lose conciousness. For ex. the town he was suposed to comue to was just an abandoned factory and he had to travlle another @NUM1 miles or so with no water.	1	1		1																					
6452	3	The humid climate and hot weather will want to make you keep over if you don’t have water in your possesion. Like near the end of the essay the person sucked on stones to try retain water better which never heard about it its time. This weather is the cause of the character ??? dihydration which is a symptom of lack of water in the body.	1	1		1																					
6453	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because in paragraph @NUM1 it say that the temperture was was getting high and that when he drank the water that it test like battery acid. This would affect him because it it was so hot and the water was starting to get hot how would he be able to get through the day with out pasing out also in paragraph @NUM2 it say the roads changed to hill when you ride up and down the hills you become tired from pumping you legs then you would feel hot and tiredd and would not want to ride the bike. That how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
6454	3	The cyclist in the story is @CAPS1 affected by the fatause of setting in the story. The Hill afected him becaus they have harder to get over.	2	2		2																					
6455	3	"The features of the setting, or environment, in which the cyclist is in greatly affects him. First of all, after leaving the campground with directions from the older gentlemen, he enters an area that is greatly isolated. In paragraph @NUM1, he wrote, ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time but on @TIME1, it fit the traditonal definition of a ghost town. ""This state of being alone later affected the cyclist because his increasing dehydration was becoming dangerous; if he were to collapse, he would most likely die. This drove the cyclist to continue on in order to survive. Another aspect that affected him was the extremely hot temperature. In paragraph, he implies the weather is hot by telling the reader he is traveling through to California desert in June. The heat gives the cyclist another obstacle to overcome in his struggling to get to the next town for water. Lastly in paragraph @NUM2, he mention the terrain changes to gently rolling hills. This shows the physical and metaphorical obstacles must get over the heat and isolation, but must also find the mental drive and determination to carry on. "	2	3		3																					
6456	3	The setting affect the cyclist in alot of ways one way is that if you dont know where your going you could get hurt. Also is if the road condition are very bad. That is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
6457	3	"In this essay features of the setting affect the cyclist in his journey to get to Yosemite makes it worse. Firts for example the cyclist was in the high deserts of California in the heat of June. Which makes it bad because of the heat makes it harder on the cyclist. Also being in the deserts there wasn’t any watwer supply so after the cyclist ran out of water it got worse because he got dyhigerated, and caused him to become weaker and not pedal as fast. Also the author says that the tarren changes from flat roads, to short rolling hills, which also made it more difficult because the short hills made it more work, and since it was so hot and he didn’t have water he couldn’t funcation as well as if he was hydrated."	2	2		2																					
6458	3	"The features in the setting of this story affect the cyclist very much so. Throughout this story this poor person has to get lost and end up in the middle of nowhere. By her being out her cycle was being affected. She was just trying to get somewhere and get things done, but of course she didn’t. She kept moving on down. This story was very good and showed that she cared and wanted it bad."	1	1		1																					
6459	3	"In this story, the cyclist had to ride threw the desert, during june and with little water. I would say that this has a big effect on the cyclist since he dehydrates alot and is threatened with heatstroke. Also he had to ride careful past a huge snake which could have hurt him. Personally I don’t know what he was doing ride threw the dessert by himself, and that’s his problem."	2	2		2																					
6460	3	"In the @CAPS1 ""Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit"" many ways affect the cyclist. Three of those things are heat, lack of water, mud its anything town. The heat affects him because he gets extremely hot and tired. For example the text states."" I could die form a heatstroke on a gergeous day in June."" this shows that it was extremly hot. The cyclist had a lack of water and was very thirsty. For example it states in the text."" I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This shows that he was very thirsty from lack of water. The last way the setting affects the cyclist is when he goes into a town and tieds it empty. The text states,"" on that morning it fit the traditional detinition at a ghost town."" This show that he expected it to be there so he could rest but it wasn't like it was appare to be things all show how the setting affected th cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6461	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in a couple of ways. The first and main way was that he was riding through the dessert. This caused him to sweat badly and get very dehydrated. The seconded way was that there were rough roads and hilly snotts this made him more tired faster. In conclusion the setting did not help him not one little bit.	2	2		2																					
6462	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist should had looked at his map instead of taking the old man advise because all the information was on the map. He almost died because he listened to the old men and didn’t look at his map. If the cyclist was in a car mabey he would have better luck because he would be going  faster than the @NUM1 bike.	3	3		3																					
6463	3	"Many things on the cyclist journey affected him. It was in the middle of summer in California. The heat is unbeleivable and rediculously hot. “… I could drop from heatstroke…” he was so bad overheated and dyhdrated that he could of died any minute. He could have also been killed by a giant snake. “…look like a diamondback- blocked the majority of the pavement…” It could have easily killed him, if he wasn’t careful. But with his determination and spite he pulled threw and made it to a fresh supply of water. If he would have gaven up his life would have been over."	3	3		3																					
6464	3	When the cyclist went to ask about the road the old men told him all its good way that he should go. But the old man hasn’t seen the land in a really long time. The man don’t long that the land has changed. So when the cyclist went back to ride the roads and everything ends ?? the cyclist didn’t know what to do.  	1	1		1																					
6465	3	There are many reasons how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. There are ways mentally and physically. The ways mentally is that the cyclists can loose determination and pride if they cannot fight the journey of cycling. The ways physically is the setting is hot and rough and the cyclist would have lack of water and food supplies. Those were the ways how cyclist would be affected by the features of the setting both mentally and physically. 	2	2		2																					
6466	3	"The cyclist in ”Rough road Ahead” was riding his bike in the middle of June, and in California. Both are very bad if you are lost and on a bike. This is because in June it usually hot, and I know in @CAPS1 it’s usually always hot, The cyclist is on a bike this means he has to pedde everywhere he goes. This is not along going to use up all his energy but also make him hot, And when your this hot you need to keep hydrated. But your lost so if you use all your water before you find safty then your in major trouble. Also In California theres like Hills, and mountains and stoff and peddling up a mountain isn’t an easy trick."	1	2		2																					
6467	3	The features of the cyclist affect him in many ways. One way that the features affected him was that when he ran out of water all the buildings were like a ghost town. He said that there was no one in sight. In the story it says “the bulding abandoned years earlier.” If I was him I would of turned around and went back so I would take the chance of not dieing out in the middle of an abandoned area.	1	1		1																					
6468	3	"The setting is the main factor on effects on the cycleist. The cycleist’s main problem is that he is low on water & dehydrated, “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” The author wouldn’t have been so dehydrated if it weren’t so hot. Also, all the problems he faces are setting related like the snake & the rough road. If it would have taken place in a more mild area, there wouldn’t have been any conflicts."	2	2		2																					
6469	3	In the story the cyclist is afected by setting because in the @NUM1 paragraph it talks about him seeing the old water pump and how he was trying to get water out. At the end of the story he gets angry when he sees the old welches juice factory because he relizes that the old men didn’t know what they were talking about. Also at the end he is realived when he finds Gary and @ORGANIZATION1 because there is water there. 	1	1		1																					
6470	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie in a very profound way. While he is riding, he sees surrounding him” no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” When he realizes his solitude when he is in a state of almost dehydration, he despairs. As a result of the seclution of the setting, having only seen “One ramshackle shed in many miles, the cyclist almost looses hope. However, hope is renewed when he thinks of “the cool pines and rushing rivers of @CAPS1.” That is how the cyclist is affected by his setting, and despair is turned to hope."	2	2		2																					
6471	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it’s very hot outside and he is starting to loose energy. The setting affects how fast he rides when he stops or when he drinks or eats. all of these depend on the type of weather he is riding in. like in the story it was so hot out when he saw a building he wiped the sweat from his face to make sure it wasn’t a mirage.	1	1		1																					
6472	3	"In the essay “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” The features of the setting had a great affect on the hard-working cyclist. The weather land and surrounding objects really determined the cyclists mood and ability. One example would be the statement, “cool pines, rushing rivers of upsemite had my name written all over them.”The refreshing nature and cool air made the cyclist feel confident energized and ready. Another example would be the quote, “One ramshackleshed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest Mule greet me.”there, the cyclist feels troubled and alittle curious as to what lay ahead this water wasn't not the best and he was worried. The last example was, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” there, the cyclist tries to stay focused through distractions. It is deserted and he feels dehydrated as well. As his route ends he comes across in manymore aspects of the setting which create a different feeling or ability. Therefore the nature of where his bike passed, and the things he saw affected his choices and ability."	3	3		3																					
6473	3	"There are many features in the setting that affect the cycleist, one of which is that he is in the middle of California riding his bike in the sun with a limited ammount of water. It affects the cyclist because he almost collapses from heatstroke and lack of water. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6474	3	"The features of the setting in this essay affected the cyclist in many ways. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was expecting a small town with people in it and some type of good water supply. However he instead found a deserted ghost town with only a rusty pump that didn’t even supply water. It made the cyclist feel depressed because he was running low on water and could easily dehydrate without it. “The speed limit was @NUM2. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM3. sometimes life can feel so cruel.” (Kurmaskie @NUM4). The cyclist is possibly being passed by cars on the highway going @NUM2 while he is only going @NUM3.This probably makes him feel as if he is getting no where at all. It would be all the more reason for him to give up. But he keeps trying to reach his destination. The feeling of being passed by the cars makes him determined to continue and finish his journey."	2	2		2																					
6475	3	The cyclist had very little water. It was very hot. He had a long way to go. The road was very bumpy so he couldn’t go to fast or he’s tire’s might bust. There were know cars in site so if he did break down it would have taken even longer.	1	1		1																					
6476	3	"The setting effects the cyclist in many ways. And following old timers advice wasn't too smart of him. In that essay he was headed to the Yosemite National Park, he had a map to follow and he trusted himself, he a cyclist he knows his way around. But came around a couple of men who told him a shortcut. He trusted them which he shouldn't have and he was on his way. The setting was rough. He was riding through a California desert; which was probably way too not, and he was looking water. The only thing that he found tasted live battery and so that no good for him. It was a flat land, than rolling hills. The next town would have been in the @NUM1 miles. This cyclist was hilling himself. While riding along these lands there was more in sight, and no building or cars it was line a dead road. Those old men had him through neck and been, once he made it to the next town he knew with those conditions"	3	2		3																					
6477	3	"On the cyclist way to Yosemite National Park, he is given directions from a group of old men, but their direction aren’t so good. The desserted place affected him because there was no where for him to stop and eat or refill his water bottle “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind”. There were rusted water pump’s, with hot water, but nothing to cool him down. His surroundings led him to the state of dehydration."	2	2		2																					
6478	3	"The features of the setting including vast emptiness, hills, heat, and no water all create obstacles for the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” @CAPS1 to the vast emptiness of the area in which he was traveling he could not stop somewhere to ask for help or to take a rest. Also there were no other travelers so he could not ask for assistance from them. Another obstacle during his trip are the hills. It takes more energy to pedal up hill so he ends up tiring easily and taking longer than expected. There is also extreme heat which causes him to sweat and even become even more thirsty. So he ends up running out of water. In the story he writes, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He is now becoming thirsty and if he doesn’t find water he @MONTH1 dehydrate. He searches for a place to rest where there @MONTH1 be water but he is not able to. All of these obstacles cause the cyclist to become devastated and give up hope but he continues his travel and eventually finds a place to rest. All of these obstacles tying into another."	3	3		3

6480	3	"The features of the setting affect a cyclist in many ways. If you have a bumpy ride, then the cyclist will have a harder time. also, if it is really hilly, then it is harder and will take longer too. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” It will take him longer to reach his destination. animals in the setting can also be effective.” and a ridiculously, large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” animals can get in the way like this snake did for the cyclist. If a squirrel or some kind of animal was to run across the rode right infront of you, it could scare you and you could clash. Sometimes trees make it cooler because you don’t have to sun beating directly down on your back. If there is a fresh water stream you can stop and wash all the sweat off of you and get a drink. The setting in which is cyclist is riding, can help or hurt the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6481	3	It affected him by dehydrating him and wearing him down to the point where he was about to give up. But he never gave up. As the end sartisfaction came out of it all.	1	1		1																					
6482	3	The trees were in the landscape and it was making the colors red and the volcanoes and the tall pine trees covered were in the landscape and milker years ago it make the swampland became the desert	1	1		1																					
6483	3	"There were a few features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One very important feature is that the cyclist was in the desert. This is demonstrated by the statement “I was travelling through the high deserts of California.” not only was the cyclist in the desert, he was there in June, one of the hottest months of the year. It is demonstrated that he was there in June reading to the statement “I was travelling in June.” @CAPS1 there at that time made dehydration a bigger risk. It was also very hot there. We know this because when he was at the water pump, he stated, “blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” From this, we can affirm that not only was at hot, the water was dirty. The water also “had the flavor of battery acid.” This was bad for the cyclist who was running low on water because he “had been hitting (his) water bottles pretty regularly.” The fact that he had little water left is demonstrated in the statement, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” The cyclist was in a bad situation. These had ganged-up against him in his trip. These features are the desert, the high temperatures, and the blackish water which tasted like battery acid. The fact that he was low on water made it harder to fight these features with water, he would battle the desert, high temperatures, and have no need to pump bad water. Again, the features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the desert, the high temperatures, and the bad water which he could not drink."	3	3		3																					
6484	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead” the cyclist was excited and determined to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist had to be thinking of the beautiful waters with “His name written over them”. The rough terrain and harsh weather took its affection on the unaware cyclist. The sun, beat down on the cyclist back, he tried to ignore it, but soon the heat made him frequently drink his water away to sips to drink. The cyclist was told by the old man a town was only @NUM1 miles aways. The town was the traditional definition of a ghost town. “That probably gave the cyclist no hope for surviving of finding anyone to help him reach his destination. The conditions of the roads, the lack of water which made him see a mirage, made the cyclist not trust the words of an old man who had led him to the abandon locations he had seen. The cyclist was affected by the settings in a bad way but in the end was given a little help from a traditional map."	3	3		3																					
6485	3	"In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because it made it more difficult for the cyclist to survive and make it through his journey. In the essay, it says, “I arrived at the first “Town”…this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time…but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost @NUM1). In the essay, the cyclist takes directions from a few old men to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist has a limited amount of water, and it was a very humid day for traveling. Because of the humidity, the cyclist nearly ran out of water when he had to cycle up, “short, rolling hills” (@NUM2) in the hot weather. Had the town been thriving, he could have bought more water to make his trip easier to accomplish. Also, if the road in the story would have been flat, he cyclist wouldn’t have gotten as tired as he did and needed more water. It would have been less strainful on the cyclist to pedal on a flat road rather than a hilly road. The challenges facing the cyclist remined me of that of the main character of the movie @PERSON2. In this movie, the main character must make his way through the extreme conditions of the desert, just like the cyclist had to in order to reach his destination. In conclusion, the setting clearly affects the cyclist’s journey in a negative way."	3	3		3																					
6486	3	"In the story, “Rough Road Ahead”, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected by the setting. The cyclist has said that he had to ride over terrain that was smooth at first but then turned into rolling hills. He also had to find his way around a big snake while being dehydrated. The cyclist was mainly affected because he was out of water when he was riding on his bike through a desert like area, but because he was determined to reach water he made it through."	2	2		2																					
6487	3	"In the selection “Do not exceed posted speed limit” there are a lot of great details of the area around the cyclist. In the text, it makes it clear that the route the cyclist is traveling is very deserted when the drinking water was explained as oozing out and tasting like battery acid, you can tell that people hadn’t been there in awhile. Also, being informed that he was traveling through a desert, in June. I am able to understand how thirsty he is. Also, he is traveling for miles over a rough terrain and “crippling hills,” according to the text, so he has to be ovely exhausted. I could understand why he was so upset with getting wrong directions based on the troubles he encounters when he finally reaches the camp and drinks water, you too are glad he has reached somewhere that wasn’t empty and deserted."	2	3		3																					
6488	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the he was traveling through a hot place at a hot time of year and didn’t have much water. In the text it says “I was traveling the high desserts of California in June.” The deserts are always hot and June is a very hot month. The cyclist was getting thirsty quicker from the heat and wasn’t able to drink much because he had limited water.	1	1		1																					
6489	3	"The setting affected the cyclist because since it was the California desert, and it was in June, it was very hot and dry. Which caused him to get very thirsty and drink all his water. After almost all his water was gone, he began to get very tired, and since it is the desert, there isn’t any one around to help him if he dehydrates and blacks out, so he has to persevere and really push through the situation if he wants to survive. But he eventually finds a bait shop and he has a drink there so he is okay."	2	2		2																					
6490	3	"In the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the setting greatly affects the cyclist. With long rides, hilly roads, and very little water the cyclist was pretty good. I mean he could have been very angry but he kept his cool and stayed calm."	1	1		1																					
6491	3	"The towns, the terrain, the Welch’s Grape Juice factory- all are parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war,” describes the cyclist, “but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” The town intensifies the cyclist feeling of doubt, in that it is increasing. At this part, he is really regretting taking the old guy's advice in taking the “shortcut.” “Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing,” reveals the cyclist. The cyclist is already very worried and very doubtful, and the terrain is making it worse it mirrors the town in which the cyclist had stopped at earlier to, again make his feeling of doubt increase. The cyclist exclaims, “ By the looks of it- had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory.” The cyclist gets very excited when he sees this, and gets a great feeling of hope. So throughout the whole story, the setting of where the cyclist is at affects his mood by giving him doubt, but by also giving him hope.  "	3	3		3																					
6492	3	"The cyclist was biking through the California deserts olwing the warm summer months. The heat and uninhabited canal was the biggest struggle for the cyclist. For example, he thought there would be many stops for water decive his trip, but he was mistaken. Also he runs out of water very quickly because of being dehydrated in the heat.

Also it stated,” At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” (Kurmaskie @NUM2). This debris and snake made him stop because he got scared and slowed him down.

The story says “over one long, crippling hill.” This makes the reader think the trip is very hard since he has to ride up so many hills. But if the road wasn’t as hilly then the trip would seem less difficult. This would also make it as if that the old guys gave good directions. But the whole point."	1	1		1																					
6505	3	"As soon as the cyclist gained information about which way to go, he set off through tall, cool pines. They  gave him a feeling of confidence, and physically cooled his body down. As he headed down the road, he encountered various small towns-none of which looked promising- which gave him a feeling of despair, in accordance to his lack of water. Even further  into. the journey, he found one last town, and arundown welche’s  @CAPS1 factory. This increased his thirst and gave him a feeling of spite towards the old men who had given him advice. However, he soon found a bait house where he could get water and escape the heat. For this he was satisfied and grateful to the owner. It made him realize to never again trust the old men."	3	3		3																					
6506	3	The setting affects alot in a cyclist. For example if you are in a city you seel rush tired and everweled. But in a forest you are happy and a bit less stress. A setting sets the mode also the attude in the story.	1	1		1																					
6507	3	"The features of the setting affect the authors dispotion as well as his ability to complete the journey, thus creating an obstacle the author must overcome. At the end of the paragraph five the author writes that “I was traveling through the high deserts of California.” This setting is important because it adds a sense of urgency to his trip when he starts to run low on water. This is similair to when I was backpacking and a bear got most of our food. Our normal backpacking trip had become more of a game of survival. So, the water issue was clearly the main point of of conflict that the author presented in the setting. He also writes that “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This aspect of the setting also affects the cyclist because it makes it much harder for him to progress than if it was a downhill road. In short, the setting of the story presents the main points of conflict to the author and thus was essential to the essay."	3	3		3																					
6508	3	"In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the unbearable setting effects the cyclist with its harsh conditions. At first, in the cyclist’s own words, “ things began well enough.” @CAPS1, this soon changes. The road is long and filled with obstacles and the cyclist has hardly any water to sip. He does not give up, @CAPS1, in the text it says, “got back on the bike, but not bothered gathered up a few peldder and stuck them in my mouth.” He does this in order to reduce his need for water and continues, ignoring the tall the setting brings upon him."	2	2		2																					
6509	3	"The cyclist is effected by the setting in “Rough Road Ahead"" because the road is a place and if it is rough or unknown, its a direct effect on the traveler, who is the cyclist. If it is a hill then the cyclist would have to climb it. In the text it said , “over a long crippling hill,” the crippiling hill part stresses that the setting is a hill."	1	1		1																					
6510	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there is mo water, hills, and deserts. When the cyclists saw water a wanting to jump in all he thought about was water that they lack like battery acid.Then the hills slowed him down from the water. The desert just made him want water even more. That are some features of the settings that affected the cyclist."	2	1		2																					
6511	3	"There were many features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One was the extreme heat during the June heat in California. The speaker said that he could have died from heatstroke. The rough road was also a problem for the cyclist. The bumps, hills and wildlife affected the cyclist’s journey. The thing that most affected him was the lack of water. It was such a problem that he had to suck on stones to take his mind off thirst. As you can see, these problems in the story affected the speaker’s journey to Yosemite National Park."	2	2		2																					
6512	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is riding in the desert where there is low to rain. This means that he can’t collect any water to drink if he runs out. Also, deserts are hot. The heat will speed up the dehydration process so he will need more water to survive. If he runs out of water, he will die. The cyclist finds a building, but it is abandoned and empty. All these features of the setting affect him. Since he can‘t find water, he has to conserve what he has. Also, the heat is killing him. It doesn’t help to have an abandoned building be the only one he finds. During the whole time that there is death in the air, the desert with nothing growing, no water, the cyclist is thinking about his death. As long as he thinks about his death, there is only more death. As soon as he puts the pebbles in his mouth to stop thinking about death and being thirsty, he sees a bait shop which saves his life. He thought about his surviving, and immediately found a shop to and he could drink."	2	3		3																					
6513	3	"The setting affected the cyclist greatly throughout his ride. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke (pG @NUM1 kurmaskie).” This quote is saying that because of the heat, the rough terrain and the length of his “shortcut” his running out of water. That’s when he realizes he could die from heatstroke because he listened to a bunch of old men."	2	2		2																					
6514	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is in the desert and has a low supply of water. Without water he tired very easily .On top of that he had to pedal a bicicle. So he was thirsty and tired prambeing in the desert. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
6515	3	"Setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist has to worry about the road condition. If the road condition is bad then the cyclist must reduce his/her speed. The cyclist also has to worry about if it is day or night. If it is night, they must be careful due to cars not being able to see them. In the text, the cyclist was in extremely hot weather. This is dangerous to cyclist if they are not prepared with things such as water."	1	1		1																					
6516	3	"The setting affects the cyclist because the cyclist believes that he has a nice, short, flat distance to travel to get to Yosemite but instead it is a long, hilly(rough),  hot journey. He only prepared himself for a quick ride, bringing only enough water for that ride, and wasn’t prepared for the reality of his ride. First of all he is riding in the middle of the day (the hottest part) in the “high deserts of colifornia in June” I know when I go to camp here in @LOCATION1 during the summer I drink I drink six to seven liters, but the author only mentions a ""few bottles of water"" which aren't going to help him in that heat. Secondly, the cyclist believed that the old men had given him a safe path to follow but instead he came across a “ridiculously large snake. It really looked like a diamond back” That is a poisonous snake and the cyclist has barely able to “ease post” it because, of his lack of water. Lastly, the cyclist expected the old men to give him an easy path on a flat terrain when in fact it was “replaced by short, rolling hills” which means you have to put more effort (using more water) to climb the hills. The setting definetely affects the cyclist because it makes it more difficult for him to reach his destination but without a few bumps in the road, how is he to learn a life lesson?"	3	3		3																					
6517	3	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting a lot. For example the dry hot place makes him thirsty. Then the ghost towns make it hard to get supplies. Also the bad road slowed him down. The bad roads even would probably hurt him and his bike the roads also would make him work harder.	1	1		1																					
6518	3	The features of the setting affected the cycalist in many bad ways. For example in the text it says how “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state”. Meaning that he had trouble being in a place he didn’t know well of and he was dehydrated. In conclusion the setting did affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
6519	3	"First the bike encounters flat roads in the desert which are very easy to navigate through; when he gets to his first town he still goes on trying to get to Yosemite, then after is going low so he looks for some more water to help him go. Then he kept going and he experienced a fork in the road. After the fork he kept going and he then faced another problem. That problem was an old person told him to go @NUM1 miles to the town and he didn’t trust the guy. Then the biker listened and he went on down the road. He then faced his next problem. The flat road started to get very wary with short high and low hills. These hills reduced his stamina greatly. Then he had to deal with a rocky and bumpy desteart road. He then had to face a snake and he had to avoid it so it didn’t attack him. Finally the biker faced his  las long hill and he finally found a bait and tackle shop with lots of water."	2	2		2																					
6520	3	"In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting by making him feel worse than he does. The cyclist is lost, has only found dirty water, and is moving on rough ground. The features of the setting are “cool pines and rushing rivers,” however, the cyclist comes to find that the “rushing river” is not so refreshing. He also encounters a terrain change, from flat road to short, rolling hills. There is a sign, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” also the name of the passage with a limit of 55 mph, while the cyclist is only going 12 mph. Ironically, he finds a picture of a boy drinking grape juice at the factory, which cause him to hang his head in misery due to his intense thirst. Finally, he comes to a fish camp, where he encounters the owner who, ironically, tells him he’d be better off using his map."	2	1		2																					
6521	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is going to be on the road a long time. The features of no buildings, no people and no cars, affect on the rider is that he feels helpless when he is low on water. The ghost town doesn’t help he because the old man told him about it and he thought he would be able to get more water. The grape juice factory affected him because he thought he would get a drink but it was abanded. This is how the features affect the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6522	3	"Features of the setting would affect me if I was the cyclist because, I would be thinking I was going to die just like he did because, there is nothing to look at, no breeze, wind, he seen a snake, he had no water. He went through three towns that had nothing. The sun was setting down on him, it was hot, he had no hope. Who knows, maybe if he would have just went with what the map had said, he would have been fine."	2	2		2																					
6523	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is running out of water and is in the intense heat in “the high deserts of California in June. The tumbleweeds that cross his path add to the desperation. Not only do the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically by dehydrating him in the heat, but also mentally. The cyclist encounters rolling hills, tumbleweeds rattle snakes and ghost towns. All of these make the cyclist start to give up hope. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically and mentally."	2	2		2																					
6524	3	"The features of the setting greatly impacted the cyclist. First the setting at the middle of the story was empty and no place to get water. This filled the cyclist with doubt and despair, he/she thought they would die. The setting also made the cyclist thirsty because of the extreme heat. Finally the cyclist was filled with regret because they regretted listening to the old men because the cyclist didn’t make it where he/she wanted to go."	2	2		2																					
6525	3	"The author think that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there was still people around. He paniced and thought he was going to die. The places were desserted and he thought the lead nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead."	2	2		2																					
6526	3	The setting really affected the cyclist. Since he was in the desert on a bike he was going to be hot and tired. Which would come from the sun coming down on him. You know he was hot where it said “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.”	1	1		1																					
6527	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they are extreme and do not change. The cyclist was riding on a small road in the desert. In the desert it was very hot and because of this the cyclist was sweating a lot and getting dehydrated. Also because he was in the desert he had no sense of direction. Also the towns are all run down with nothing in them, so the cyclist couldn’t get any water to drink to rehydrate himself. Only when he comes to a small bait shop close he finally get water."	2	2		2																					
6528	3	"The setting really afeted the cyclist alot.The sun and hot weather dehidrated him. He also had pretty much ran out of water. In the story he says ""The bottles contained only a few drops this shows that he had drank almost all of his water. Then it says ""the growing relization that I could drop from a leaf stroke"" shows the heat was affecting him."	2	2		2																					
6529	3	"The setting was calm and peaceful as he started out riding his bike. He was smiling and his legs were strong. As he hit the @NUM1 town and saw a ramshackled shed, rusty pumps, and a corral, he begun to be troubled b/c he was running out of water. As the flat rodes were replaced wI short, rolling hills he became even more troubled.  When he saw a building he became happy but when he found out it was run down he was sad, thirsty, and tired. When he finally saw an old man and told him he had a map he became a little happier b/c he was going to get to Yosemite. As the setting became worse his mood became worse b/c he had less and less water and felt very hopeless. But when he saw the man he became happy b/c the map was going to help him."	2	2		2																					
6530	3	"The setting of this story is very rigurous. At the begining of the story the boy was fine. He had a bottle of water with him so that he didn’t get dehydrated. When he was riding he started to feel the sun get higher into the sky, though he could barely feel. It because of the pines that caused the road, and the cool feel of the river. The cyclist got to the second town on his journey and he had been drinking his water all day and was about out. He had found a water pump. He got down on his knees and palled with his night hot all that came but was blackish water. He just feared the water and stated that it tasted like battery acid. He began to ride again. Not two miles up the road the terrain changed. Not only was it rolling hills, it was also getting hotter. He was majorly dehydrated because he was out of water except nor a few “tantalizing sips. Dry sweat circled his shirt and he was afraid he could froz up heatstrokes. Where he was at was in the middle of no where, with no buildings, cars or structures in sight. Over were of the hills he saw a building came in no view. He wiped the sweat off his eyes so makee sure it was not a malinge,” By the lols of it had been a Welch’s @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Factory.” He is a dehydrated and tired that he could see a “Young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.” There is only the problems it is abandoned. This person was imagining things. He got back on his bike and stuck pebbles into mouth. This was to help tabe his mind off being thirst."	3	2		3																					
6531	3	I read “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” written by Joe Kurmaskie in the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist by accepting advice from “old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches @CAPS1 was in office”	1	1		1																					
6532	3	"In the essay “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First, the sun is making the cyclist hot and dehydrated. He states “The sun was beginning to beat down,” @CAPS1, the sun was a big factor on the affect on the cyclist. Also, the hills of the country roads. Going up and down hills take alot of work you have to use alot of energy. The cyclist says “@CAPS2 were replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS3, there were snakes in the road, which make the cyclist timid looking out for snakes so he would not get bit. Againg the cyclist states “dimond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” @CAPS4, there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then crushed his hopes. The factory even made him more thirsty. @CAPS1, there were many affects on the cyclist due to the setting."	2	3		3																					
6533	3	"The features of the setting take their toll on the unfortunate cyclist. For example.” I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” The deserts of California especially in June are hot and dry and caused the cyclist to use much of his water supply, very quickly. As he “toiled” on, the terrain features became even more trying,” over one long, crippling hill…”By this time the cyclist barely had enough energy to make it over a hill from all the wear and tear his body was put through by the features of his setting."	2	2		2																					
6534	3	"The settings to this story has an encouraging impact on this story, because he is an alike ride. The terrain in the story sounds rough where he seen a sign marked, ‘Rough road ahead do note exceed posted speed limit.” He already has to go up and down hills with rocks and no water. Such a setting an a really athletic ride can be devastating. "	1	1		1																					
6535	3	"The feature of the cyclist and the settings arn’t that good. There’re insidents that are a problem. One is the bad weather. There is a tempature that makes it feels pretty close to @NUM1 degrees. He stops at a water pump, water comes out but it is really not cool. He takes two little sips and its like battarey acid. If he would to drink alot of that water it would probably kill him or make him very ill. He needs something because there was another town @NUM2 miles down the road so he has to find something to keep him going. As he is going down the road he sees a sign: Rough Road Ahead: Even though he is going 12 mph he could still hit a hole and go flying over his handle bars. If he does go over his handle bars he could run into the snake he saw then get eaten by the birds because he wouldn’t have any energic to get up. There’re some interesting sence in the story."	2	2		2																					
6536	3	"Heat, water supply, energy-all are features of setting that can affect a cyclist. First, is heat. When it is too warm out it makes it more difficult, and more inconvenient to ride. Second, is your water supply. If you are riding, and begin to run low on water, your in trouble. The author describes, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips”. If you arn’t prepared enough for your cycling journey, it will be extremely inconvenient when you run out of supplies. Lastly, is energy. If you run out of energy while cycling, you have nothing. Your energy is what keeps you moving and motivated. “With what I believe, was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,” the author describes. When you are out of energy, your ride is over. all of these aspects are important to have before deciding to go on a cycling journey."	2	2		2																					
6537	3	The features of the setting affect the setting affect the cyclist by. Dehydrating him due to the heat and lack of water and to see mirages. And he loses strength going over the many hills.

6540	3	In the story “Do not exceed Posted Speed limit” a cyclist takes a journey through terrain to get to Yosemite. In that part of California there are not a lot of towns or people. The rode he is rideing on is very dangerous and long. It is very dry and hot out there but	2	2		2																					
6541	3	"The setting can affect a cyclist in a lot of ways. One way setting affects cyclist is when it is hot, it is harder to cycle long distances. I say this because in the story the narrator says “…and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke…” @CAPS1 part of setting that affects cyclist is the terrain they cycle on. For example it is much easy to cycle on flat smooth ground than it is on the rolling hills with rough, rocky ground. This is shown with the quote “…ride down into distances I could see over the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.” Setting can have a great deal of affect on a cyclist, depending on if its smooth or rocky, or hot or cool.

6542	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed the Speed Limit” the features of the setting affects the cyclist a great deal. Each feature causing the cyclist to act. For example, in reaching the ‘ramshackle shed’ the cyclist finds the water inusuable; which causes to conserve water and try to head for the next town. That action leads him deeper into the high deserts of California during June. Also as the terrain changes from flat road to short, rolling hills the cyclist must change his speed to better survive and continue in his dehydrated state. The scarcity of buildings in this dry desert terrain causes the cyclist to try every ‘shack or building he comes across for water. In this story the features of the setting dictates the actions of the cyclist in his quest to survive in the desert a lot."	2	2		2

He get low on water & the setting is horrible. He is on his way from a camp ground in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 to the Yosemite river. He gets bad directions from old guys at the camps ground. On his way he ran into two abandon towns & was running out of water then he came to a sign that said, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” He was pedeling over hills & becoming dehydrated when he tought he was going to die he came to a bait shop & got waiter & met an old guy who was going to give him direction & he decided he better stick to the map.

6544	3	"Heat, hills and ghost towns – all are features of setting that affect the cyclist. First, the heat dehydrates and exhausts him, almost causing him a heat stroke. He starts dinking more often, and nearly runs out of water. Next is the hills. They can take massive amounts of energy to climb. Which adds to his dehydration. Finally the ghost towns. They make his journey seem hopeless. Which could cause him to lose the will to carry on."	2	2		2																					
6545	3	The cyclist is in the desert which @NUM1 degrees with water that tastes like the battery acid. The desert makes him see the mirages having sweat get into his eyes. In the story  “Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie 	1	1		1																					
6546	3	"In the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the author tells a story about when he took advice from “old folks” and became lost.

6548	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way it affected him was time because of the road he had to go slower so took him longer to get to the town. Also because the road was harder to peddle on he got thristy and the water was really hot.	1	1		1																					
6549	3	"There were several features of the setting that held an affect on the cyclist in this story. For one, the cyclist was riding in a hot desert. This condition normally prevents one from obtaining water. Seeing as how water was a necessity for the cyclist, the lack there at due to the desert created the conflict of dehydration. Additionally, the town that was abandoned triggered a spark of doubt in the cyclist’s mind. The cyclist now had to ride with his brain in doubt and his body in desperate hope. By the time he/she reaches the old factory, the cyclist is extremely dehydrated. Now his head is screaming with annoyance and his body is screaming with lack of water. This abandoned juice factory almost completely wiped out the cyclist hope. A man is little to nothing without hope. Therefore, this abandoned factory had a negative affect on him. Now, the only reason he continues is out of his/her desperation of survival, an instinct in all of us. In conclusion, the desert removed water and the abandoned homes and factory removed hope and all three created a negative affect. The cyclist is lucky to have survived. "	1	1		1

A setting the cyclist faces is that its so hot he keeps taking (drinking) water, and worrying that he is going to run out. Kurmaskie writes, “ I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in @NUM1). This is what the cyclist gets affected by throuout the whole story as he releizes he could die of heatstroke if he dosent watch how much water hes drinking. Also, this is what a lot of people normally face which is a challenge cause of dehydration."	2	2		2

6553	3	"Many things about the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. The terrain in this story is hilly and filled with deserts. This contributes to the cyclist nagging sensation for a drink of water. The ride on the hills and through the desert, also tire him out dramatically. Not to mention while he is severely dehydrated, and when he finds the water it is “tarlike” and ""in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees”. The cyclist in this story really must want to get Yosemite National park if he is willing to go all through all this trouble. The old men he asked in Lodi, California hadn’t left the town in decades and gave the cyclist faulty directions that could of killed him. So he asked for directions and was given inadequet information, which made life very difficult for the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6554	3	"The setting of “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” affect the cyclist so many ways. First of all, the cyclist is riding in a desert, in mid- June, with the heat “beginning to beat down” on him. This feature of the setting causes the cyclist to drink more water, but when his supply of water was running low, he was unable to drink much water to hydrate himself. The cyclist began to realize that he “could trap from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” @CAPS1, the long distance and changes in the terrain that the cyclist was travelling, affected him. The distance on which to cyclist was travelling to Yosemite National Park, consisted of hours and miles of riding. Over vast changes of terrain. The “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills”, which affected the cyclist speed and energy to finish his trip."	3	2		3																					
6555	3	A response that explains how the features of setting affect the cyclist by getting wrong dirachion The old man. One features when tough an ghost town.

6556	3	"The features of the setting will affect the cyclist because the roads are hilly and he is old so it will be hard for him to ride up them. It was very hot and he had a scares supply of water.

6557	3	"Well some features of the setting like the hotness is effecting the cyclist, for example he was riding through the high deserts of California and was drinking to much of his water. So when he stoped at a place the pipes and things to get water were rusty and old. Another was when he thought he could make it to the other town to get water their. He started his ride the the roads were hilly and short. Then the road turned into bumpy to. So know matter what we was having bad trouble any way. "	1	1		1

6559	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance the desert is not a hummid making is lack of water a bigger deal than normal. Also these are many hill making him have to use full force to get up them also making water a big deal. In conclusion I temperatures where level and it was flat land he could go further with less water supply.	2	2		2																					
6560	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by never accept travel advice from colletion of old timer who haven’t left there porches since carter was in office. After that because you don’t know if they are real collection or what. After because some people have not left there porches since carter was in office.

He ends up cycling in a desert with no water just barley able to push the pedals of his bike. The setting affects the cyclist by it being so hot, him not having anything to drink, nowhere to get water or food and him maybe seeing mirages. In the essay it states, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke.” This shows that the lack of water and the surrounding enviroment with nowhere to go is making him give up hope to survive. It also says in the essay, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasen’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. “The cyclist is coming out himself and stating that the dessert has him thinking hes seeing something and letting him down by it not being real. The desert setting of this essay effects the cyclist in many ways other then one."	2	2		2

Being hot from the sun beating down on him took away the cyclist’s energy he needs for riding his bike. Another feature that affected the cyclist was his lack of water. “Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This affected the cyclist by making him tired. Being tired from no water, the cyclist had trouble going up hills on his bike. The last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his road. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” These hills made it hard to go up on a bike, considering his lack of water, and the heat. All of these features affect the cyclist by making him lose energy and get tired and frustarated because of their negative impact."	3	3		3

In “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie is a perfect example about settings laffect people like cyclist. When you’re riding your bike as actually cross country transportation, you have to know what your doing and where you’re going. The cyclist in this story decided to take advice from older fellows and ends up going the wrong route for a cyclist because at these “town” they had no water, because they weren’t towns to begin with, not anymore atleast. If you don’t have any water like this guy did hills could kill you. And in any case, you have to know what to do for example.” l gathered a few pebbles and struck them in my mouth. I’d read once that sucking on stones help take your mind off thrist” This guy knew a little bit of survival tips.

The pump began it shoot out a tarlike substance and the water was feeling somewhere of two hundred degrees. Two more miles I noticed the terrain changing from a flat road to a short, rolling hills.” He said tumble weeds crossed her path and a large snake crossed her pavement.

For example, “…I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” (pg @NUM1). Flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on. The change from flat land to hills affected his stamena and will to keep going. He really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill.

One such feature is the hills that are present in the essay. These probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him. Another feature was the road sign that said “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it. Also, the sign advertising grape juice probably made him feel life was even crueler with its sadistic irony. Finally, the bait shop offered much relief to the cyclist. “I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.” All in all, the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end."	2	2		2

It caused him to go dehiderated because lack of water and he went kind of dilerious. He thought he was seeing things and his vision was distorted. Next, the water he had to come across in the pump was un drinkable because of the tarlike substance coming out of it and the degree of water he said it was, which was @NUM1 degree. Lastly, the Welch’s factory that he came across was teasing him in in the way that he couldn’t have the liquids he needed and the little boy advertised on the building was drinking his refreshed Welch’s juice.

6575	3	"The setting affects the cyclist in almost everything he does and everything he faces. The setting is a hot day in June in the dessert. There are many hills and the terrain changes a few times. Because the day is hot the cyclist drinks lots of water. And because he drinks lots of water he very soon runs out. In the story it states, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June. This quote shows that because it was so hot, the cyclist drank lots of water and because he drank lots of water he very quickly run out of water. Also in the story it states, “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This quote suggests that becaused the terrain changed to hills, the cyclist became very tired and hot from having to pedal up and down those hills. And because this caused him become hot and tired he also drank his water more quickly than if he was pedaling on a flat paved road in a cool day in @DATE1.

There also aren’t many places to cool off at. They also described the water and Lodi to be about @NUM1 degree in temperature.

There was a rather large snake in his path. You can tell he isn’t an expert on snakes because he couldn’t identify it. Because he is in the desert on a long bike ride, he is dehydrated. His water supply is almost gone. The cyclist feared many dangerous challenges in his journey."	3	2		3																					
6579	3	"The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the terrain, the lack of provisions and the power of self- determination. The terrain affected the cyclist by having he/she ride through rough paths inorder to reach their destination.For example, if you walk on sharp rocks, you are based to reach some rough spots where it seems you can’t walk. But that is where self–determination kicks in. The power to keep yourself moving even though there @MONTH1 be obstacles in your way; you know there will be a better path or a reward at the end another example of a feature is a lack of provision on your trip, when you don’t have the right provision to keep you self energised you can ‘t get over your obstacles or even push yourself to do anything.This is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	2	2		2

This shows that he has been drinking his water too fast due to the heat from being in the desert at summertime. After travelling from a long time with no water he lets out a chuckles thinking of how he shouldn’t have taken the old mens advise. He explains that “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” This is an example of how badly the terrain had effected him. Its gotten to him so much that he applauds himself for having the energy to feel sorry for himself."	2	2		2

Also in the story is says, ""flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills."" This could of made the journey even harder for the cyclist because now he had a little more effort to get up the hills one more example is towards the end he says ""i began breaking my ride down into distances, i could see the horizon telling myself i could make it there."" By the cyclist saying this it seems like he has given up and he realizes that this journey is going to never end untill he dies. That is how the setting on the story affected the cyclist."	2	2		2

An additional part of the setting which caused major doubt was that he was in a deserted desert. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The horizon was what kept cyclist going. “I began breaking the ride down into distarres: I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.’ The horizon kept him hopeful and determined.

The cyclist only has a limited supply of what he needs and riding through there does not help him. For example, the old men who gave him directions made him think he could make it longer before he could elgo. This affected him because throughout his journey his lack of water slowed him down and made him think he wasn`t going to make it.

Another feature was the Grape Juice Factory, also abandoned, so he hung his head and that blues tune “summer time” rattled in his brain. A third feature was his thirst.

This cyclist took the advice of bunch old men who thought they knew a short cut to the Yosemite national park. This short cut turned out to be a nightmare. The cyclist had only brought so many water bottles and was quickly drinking them all. The setting of this story changed a lot making the cyclist at   times have to pedal faster and slowes. The cyclist was quickly worn out and started to loose hope in himself. The  terrain kept changing making it  hard for him not to be thirsty. Eventually he drank all of his water and knew he would die of dehydration or a heat stroke.

Also, his water supply was getting low which drained his energy alot quicker than usual. The heat also played a part of his energy loss. The heat made him sweat perfusely which made the water that was in his body be of no use.    "	2	1		2

He thinks as he rides over the “crippling hills” that maybe this wasn’t such a great idea. Finally he comes to a old bait shop, and the “modern bathroom” that he enters to drink from, gives him relief from the desert he had just been riding through."	2	2		2

Water was a factor because he need cool water to keep him hydrated he came to a shed with pumps after running out of water. He started pumping the water it was hot but he took it he tried to let it cool down but it didn’t. Rolling hills was another a tender to the cyclist hardships because the road started off flat then ended up in hills going up his can strain the leg and makes it harder to keep riding. Another hardship was road condition, it was smooth at frist then it became rough and rocky. Those was some affects the cyclist had to over come"	2	2		2

This quote shows that his surroundings were giving him diffuculty and a challenge for his travel. By describing the hills as ""rolling"" it helps the reader imagine the obstacles he was going through. Also, the sign that read, ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" gives the reader a feeling that the character is in danger. Lastly an example of the setting that helps shows the charcters hardships is, ""no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any hand."" If anything were to the happen to the character, as the author was foreshadowing, he'd be stranded and all alone to die. He'd be in trouble and there would be no one to help him. If the author did not use these examples, the reader would not easily get a picture of the troubles he had to overcome. In conclusion these examples added emphasise and meaning to the text.

6635	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The hills afected the cyclist because they would be harder for him to ride The abandoned town also affected him. When he got to the town he was hoping he could get more water and take a break but when he got there the town was abandoned. Also the highway was hard for him because it would be hard for him to ride on. Also there was nowhere that he could get water around him. Many features of the setting affected him.	2	2		2																					
6636	3	"The features of the setting gradually contribute to the cyclist’s anger. For example, at the beginning of the story, the cyclist comes across poisonous snakes, “one ramshacke shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule.” All of sights trouble the narrator, and he starts to becom frightened and neurotic. As he cycles on, the narrator begins to deplete his water supply, and when he stops to restock, “the water wouldn’t cool down” and “it had the flavor of battery acid. The cyclist’s lack of water frustrates him, and the increasing steepness of the hills adds to his annoyance. The final straw came when the cyclist passed by what he thought “had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory.” The narrator goes on in an outrage to explain that hopes to die out on the road, in order to spare himself from the dreaded features of the setting.  "	3	2		3																					
6637	3	"The features in the setting most definetly affect the cyclist while he travels. The cyclist is incredibly thirsty and tired and the setting he’s placed in just gives him no hope of survival really. He first comes to a “ghost town” where he finds no one is living. This first encounter with isolation in a desolute place doesn’t really affect him because it is the first place he finds but the rest of the storys setting comes to mimic this. As he travels he is met with barren land, no water and no people in sight. It’s June in California and the cyclist fears he @MONTH1 soon suffer from heat stroke if he doesn’t find water yet. It doesn’t help when he comes to an abandoned juice factory that taunts him with the one thing he needs to survive.

6638	3	"The setting in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was based in the hot, and dry terrain of California. This setting affected the character mood. It did this because some of its included feature can seem as actual metaphorically based moods. An example from the story is, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite...” this quote from the story could suggest the tone and the mood of the scenery which would be calm, and relaxed. So from the scene that is being seen and the mood it has would also give the character its mood."	2	2		2																					
6639	3	The features of the setting that affect cyclist depends where they are located. In this story the feeling on “nothing and the desert around him and the heat gave him no hope”. It all depends on where you are cycling. “It didn’t really matter I was going to die.” This quote states his feelings on what was going on through his head while he was dieing of thirst. He felt nothing he was sure he was going to die until he found a sign of civilization that was near and he became better and his hope was raised.	2	2		2

6643	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist, in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, in many ways. The cyclist is affected because the setting is depressing and frightening. When the cyclist first sees the speed limit sign of 55 mph, he says, “Sometimes life can be so cruel”. Because he can only go 12 mph considering he's on a bike. After seeing the sign, a snake crosses his path. He’s frightened by it because it looked like a diamond back and he was trying to keep his balance and ease past it. Since the main problem the cyclist is faced with is the lack of water, the dry, long hills seem to make him more weak and tired. Tumble weeds crossed past him and there was no water in sight That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	2	2		2

This causes him to become delighted much faster while he is on a “Short hit” leading to no where. ”Wide signs of dried outcast winded my limb, and the growing realization that I could drop from ?? a gorgeous day in June” This gust shows how that calm day really was and the fact the cyclist is sweating so much shows how much the weather is affecting him. The rolling hills in the story also affect the cyclist. By cycling towards up and down no often, it secured his journey. It cowed him to the side even longer in getting to a town with water.The deserted knowns in the setting are negatively also affected the narrator.

He no longer had that much water. He ran into a snake, which he swore was a alamond back. Finally, he came to another town, got some water and then left after going through ghost towns.

For example, the text states, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The author has a sort of negative, sarcastic tone at this point. This shows that he’s getting frustrated and losing some hope.

Also, if frustrates him that when he finds water, not only is it hot it tastes like battery acid @CAPS1, when the cyclist decides to conserve some of his water and go to the next town to get more water, but there is another setback. The condition of the road is so poor, that the cyclist cannot go more that 12 mph. Thus, if he ever reaches the next town. he still will have to wait longer for the much needed water, travelling at 12 mph.

Also, when he sees the juice factory he puts some pebbles in his mouth and says, “It didn’t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This shows that seeing the broken down juice factory gave him no hope and he tells his self that he will die."	2	2		2																					
6677	3	"In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting had a major impact on the character. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park, but on the way, he had some troubles, the fact that there was not much civilization affected the cyclist because he was not able to refill his water bottles, so he grew very thirsty. Also, the many hills and the fact that it is summer impacted him greatly because he became tired out more easily and could not pedal as fast. When it says, “A tar like substance oozed out Wouldn’t cool down,” it showed how he wasn’t able to drink. Also, when he passed the grape juice factory, it must have been torture to him since he was so thirsty. If he hadn’t taken the advice of the men in the first place he would have had a much shorter ride and would not have been so exhausted. The setting affected the cyclist a lot in this essay."	3	3		3																					
6678	3	"The cyclist is beginning at what seems a fine idea and place. Then the conditions become hot, dreadful, and maybe sticky. The constant heat without any breeze was getting to the character. Mirages appeared, or so he thought. He actually thought he might die. Not quite an optimistic one is he? “ It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean…” The heat must have been bad, he wasn’t thinking straight and was slowly checking himself into a mental center! Although painful heat was a brilliant way to learn a lesson in cycling, and the old men “helping” with directions."	2	2		2																					
6679	3	"As he began his journey, he had full confidence in the directions given given to him by the old men. After he came to the first town and there was no water, he rode on. After he found an “ramshackle shed” he became troubled , as he “had been “hitting“ his “water bottles regularly“ and was traveling through the “desert of California in June” and was running low on water. Coming to a place where he saw a building over hills, he “manuevered” his way down, only to find it long  deserted and himself close to despair. He was desparate for water he needed it soon. Finally, he came upon “@CAPS1 and Wilber’s Fish Camp” and quenched his thirst, and was relieved. Then on  he wised up, and took no more directions from old men who knew little to nothing about cycling."	2	2		2																					
6680	3	"The features of the setting in the story “DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, affect the cyclist in the story, in many ways. The first of which would definetly be the lack of water the cyclist had, and the fact that there wasn’t anywhere around for miles. From the text it read “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This evidence from the text proves to the reader that the cyclist was getting worried. Another part of the setting would be the obvious element of temperature. The cyclist is our in the hot, relentless desert. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The author here, by using the elements of nature, is trying to make the reader concerned/scared for the main character. The final key had to travel and the road conditions. Although the desert is flat, he began to notice some hills in the road, and such a long distance, including the heat, could be deadly. The setting’s elements, greatly effect the cyclist in this story."	2	3		3																					
6681	3	"The cyclit of “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, was greatly affected by the setting of his bike ride, which caused him pain and displeasure. He travels in the high deserts of California in June, which he exaggerates that water there was “@NUM1 degers”. The great heat caused him to drink lots of water, depleting it much quicker than he would’ve wished. It also sopped the energy out of him, further complicating his ride. Along the way there is literally nothing there and he has nowhea  to replenish his water supply. The hilly, rough terrain also calls for hard, tough peddling, sopping even more energy. The heat, terrain, and lack of places to stop combined for an awful ride for the cyclist of this story."	2	2		2																					
6682	3	"The lone biker in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” by @PERSON1 is strongly affected by the features of the landscape. The sun is the most important factor; it drives him to first consume his water quickly, and then drives him search for a water source.”The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it...I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly,” in this quote, it reveals that even though the biker had not acknowledged the sun, his body had required water, depleting his supply in his water bottles. A lack of water feeling two hundred degrees...it had the flavor of battery acid."" The only water that the bike is able to find is not consumable. The most important of the factors, in the matter of survival, is the fish camp that the biker finally reaches. ”I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.” The biker had been on the brink of dehydration and the fish camp is where he finally reganed the strength to continue on his journey."	3	3		3																					
6683	3	"Dry, thirsty, tedious-all are features of setting that affect the cyclist. First, everything is dry. The cyclist isnt any where near a town that could help him. He has been pedaling in the heat, outside for a long time. Secondly, He is very thirsty. The way he is travelling is a good sign he is in need of water. He went fourty miles before he reached the first town to stop at. He also is on a bike, So that doesn’t leave him much room to carry water along. Lastly, the trip is tedious. He has been going for forty miles, and the speed limit is 55. He hasn’t acceded 12 mph. All to gether, the cyclists trip seems to be adventure that takes a lot of heart."	1	1		1																					
6684	3	"the setting affects the cyclist very strongly in the story because mentally and physically he wasn’t ready for where he was going. For example the text states “No a better, piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be never. Accept traver advice from a collection of old timers who wasn’t left the cosines of theer poiches since calter was in office.” So a youg guy took maid advice from older guys about how to get to a pack backin thier day it probably was a shortcut.   "	1	1		1																					
6685	3	"The setting affected the cyclist because it was very hot and he didn’t have any more water also, there aren’t any towns that had good water in them, until he eventually arrived at this fishing comp. Due to his lack of water, he became dehydrated and really weak. “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,” this quote shows that he was beginning to become dehydrated and losing his energy."	1	2		2																					
6686	3	Different settings can effect how well your bycycle ride goes. If it is hot and you have lots of hills it makes it hard. If you have no hills and it is a sunny breezy day it makes it nice to ride. In the essay the biker had no water left but was going down a hill. The going down the hill part was probably easy but the fact that he had no water left was not a good thing.	2	3		3																					
6687	3	"The setting from the story left the cyclist in a mental way because most of the time the sun was on his mind due to the fact that he was pedaling hard in a hot summer day in June. The cyclist had very little water and with him biking under a beating sun wasn’t exactly helping him. He  had to like disasterous events like, peddling slopes than the normal speed, a snake blocking the path, old men telling to take a different route then be infected, and the fact that his water supply was low made him think he was going to pass out under the burning sun. However his determination was strong as he continued on pedaling through and he eventually found himself in another town but this time with people, fish and water."	2	2		2																					
6688	3	"From the setting that affected the cyclist are possible conditions such as the weather and surrounding enviorment like hills and streams or even tyes of animals and if they are poisenous or not. The setting has and can change the desision a cyclist makes."	1	1		1																					
6689	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the hot sun makes the cyclist dehydrated and since there is no water sources around the cyclist is not getting any water. The rough terrain makes the cyclist tired.	1	1		1																					
6690	3	"Many features of the carlifonian desert influenced the cyclist during his ride.Ghost towns, rolling hills, and dangerous snakes influenced the cyclists experience during the''shortcut'' to yosenite.The Ghost towns along the journey syndized the world desrting him during his ride by offering no help with water supply as a place to cool dowdn.The road sign warning of rough terrain was another barrier on his bike ride that he had to get through in dehydration to reach his goal,yosenite.The diamondback rattlesnate caused additional horror to the cyclist's'' ride from hell''.He had to manuever around the serpent while unstable from dehydration.All features of the cyclist's riding setting affected his ride to yosenite."	3	2		3																					
6691	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if it’s raining or snowing it affects the cyclist because pavement can be wet and icy. Which causes the cyclist to slip and @DATE1 and the cyclist can really get injured. Also the cyclist has to wear a helmet if it’s very hot outside you wouldn’t see the cyclist in winter clothes. This would make the cyclist unfocus and the cyclist wouldn’t be able to finish any race.	1	1		1																					
6692	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he can’t go any farther because of the hills, and the snake. When he finds the bait shop he’s relieved. He relieved because he can get something to drink. He can also buy the worms to eat. The cyclist didn’t really know where he was going because there wasn’t a car, building, or structure in sight. So the cyclist just keeps on riding until he comes across the bait shop or the first “town” as he calls it in the essay. When he comes across the road that has 55 mph per limit, and he’s only 12 he knows that he’s not going anywhere near Yosemite National Park."	2	2		2																					
6693	3	"The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affects the cyclist in many ways. First the setting does not look like what the cyclist has been told it lacks like. The cyclist had stopped to get directions from a group of older men who’s directions were out of date. Second the conditions of the road affects the cyclist. In the essay the cyclist explains that, ”Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” A final feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the temperature. The hot sun beamed down on the cyclist. As you can see, the features of the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affects the cyclist in many ways. "	2	2		2																					
6694	3	"The different settings in the essay/ writing affect the cyclist because of how old and hopeless they look. I think this because when the cyclist stops at the first town, he’s looking around expecting to find a quaint, bustling little place, but instead he finds these abandoned, decimated old houses. And if you yourself can picture being in his situation, then you can imagine how discouraging and almost frightening that must be. As the cyclist continues for a few more miles, he’s becoming slowly dehydrated, and finally sees a building. At first, he thinks this building is a mirage; he was wrong, but for him in this situation it was worse- an old juice factory, right when point you kind of get the feeling that every things turning against you and that there’s no hope left. But when he finds the fishing camp, his entire perspective of things changes, and he just feels so thankful to have been saved."	3	3		3																					
6695	3	The setting affected the cyclist by the people from Lodi get him into the wrong way and he had to survive from there so he that was very dry and No water or nothing to the next stop was at the bait store so he was determined to get to next stop destination by he did want to give up own but the guy ask him did he want direction he said he was not going to be fooled twice.	1	1		1																					
6696	3	"It can’t be known as, ""easy"" to ride through a desert on a bike. Adding rough pavement, rusty water pumps, and not so friendly animals adds to the discomfort as well. The cyclist in this story encountered all these things, making his supposedly pleasurable ride turn to a semi brutal experience “it got down on my hands and knee, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. Alike substance ooed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees, “This quote shows how the conditions of his water supply where, which eventually lead him to dehydration. It lead: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT @CAPS1 SPEED LIMIT.”This quote also shows how the riding conditions were making the  cyclist have a harder time keeping speed. “at some point tumberweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-beaked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” @CAPS2, this quote show of some of the dangers the  cyclist encountered. If  these features did not appear, then maybe the story would be describing a nice bike ride, but once you read about them, it becomes more of a disaster."	3	3		3																					
6697	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. It was so hot where he was that he kept drinking his water without realizing it until he only had a couple of sips left. The terrain also made him thirsty because the more he had to go up and down hills, the more he would drink. The fact that he did not see any town except on ghost town for miles affected him because he did not think he was going to make it to the next town. The setting played a major role on the cyclist because it affected him that much."	2	2		2																					
6698	3	Setting plays a big role in this story. Without being in the desert in the hot @DATE1 there would not be a confict. There would be no importance in saving the water so he would not dehiderate. And the long flat roads are a symbol that the journey has still got a far way to go but as straight roads turn into hills it shows that there is a change in the journey and something better is about to happen.	2	2		2																					
6699	3	"The setting affect is used to a great extent in the short story “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit” The cycleist had beed going for a very long time when he came to the first town and there was no water At this point you can tell that he has lost confidence the “old timers"" directions. From this quote; “a ton-like substance oozed out.” This quote shows how after @NUM1 miles of pedaling when he was supposed to have come to two towns by that point his one chance of water had been depleated. The next time the setting affect is used is when he comes for a building that was rusted out. He said, “I hung my head” this shows how he almost completely lost all hope and that he was sure that he is going to die."	3	3		3																					
6700	3	"The cyclist is affected by @NUM1 couple different things. First, he is given directions that are out of date and then he has to deal with the heat of the weather in the early summer of California. If that wasn’t enough, he then runs out of water, which he needs very badly. He runs into a couple more problems, like seeing a big snake and coming to a factory that used to make juice and it was now run down and empty. After all of these obsticles, the cyclist pulls through and makes it to @NUM1 fishing store, where he gets water."	2	2		2																					
6701	3	"During the cyclist’s biking adventure he encounters several interesting situations. Each experience is in response to the setting in which it takes place. For example, this young man starts out confident with a bright hope of eventually reaching Yosemite National Park. The first spot he comes to is a ghost town This sight doesn’t immediately affect him, however it greatly adds on to the long term effects. He decides to continue on his treck reaching the next ghost from at this time he is becoming dehedrated due to his lack of water supply He decides to keep persueing his good and figures there must be water up ahead in the next town. In order to get the next town he must encounter some precarious situations including some changes in terrain. Eventually after reaching a source of running water he is overjoyed with happiness and relief. As evident in the provided text this man was effected by each feature of the setting. The different settings greatly affected his nature of confidence."	3	2		3																					
6702	3	The setting effects the rider because if it’s hot you get thirsty and you have no water.This kind of question is hard to answer	1	1		1																					
6703	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making the journey more dangerous and difficult. For example, in the reading it states that rediculously large, poisonous diamond back snakes. Blocked majority of the pavement. So, the cyclist had to keep his/her balance to ease past them. The terrian also changed into short, rolling hills, making it even more difficult. "	1	1		1																					
6704	3	"The features in the setting of the essay affect the author in one major way, dehydration. There are several features that causes the author to dehydrate. First off, he is riding throught a desert located in california. This means that there is bent from the sun constintly beating down on him. Also the change from “Flat read”, (Kurmaskie) to “short, rolling hills” (@CAPS1) also affected him, getting dehydrated. This change cased him to use more energy to climb up the hills which means he used more water because he got thrister faster. This is how the features in the setting affected the author of the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.”"	2	2		2																					
6705	3	"The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. For example, the tough terrain made it very difficult for the cyclist to reach his destination, Yosemite. He was already very fatigued but had to overcome hills. In the essay, he states, “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. The setting features also affected the cyclist when he encountered the snake. He was dehydrated and could barely navigate around the dangerous snake. The cyclist explains, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a riduculously large snake, it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased fast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The setting also affected the cyclist because there was no one around him to help. The cyclist describes, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The cyclist was all alone and had to rely on himself to make it to Yosemite. In conclusion, the features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. He had to overcome ruggid terrain without energy, avoid a diamondback snake, and make it all the way to Yosemite because there was no one around. As you can see, the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	3	3		3																					
6706	3	"The features of the land around the cyclist caused him to confront  nature. when he began his trip with advice from “old coggers” he “ rode out with strong legs and a smile.” As he came to the first town, he describes it as a “ghost town” having no water and no human contact for some time. This should have been his cue to stop and turn around in hopes of another route to Yosemite. But with strong determination, he rods on. Through the miles he incountered a ramshackie shed, rusty pumps, snakes,and the wicked terrain. The short rolling hills tested his “inner spirit” and caused his dehydration to further. The land around the cyclist not only victimized his heath but also caused a poor way to spend a vacation."	2	2		2																					
6707	3	"The harsh features at the setting affect the cyclist by hindering his journey to Yosemite National Park. As the cyclist is traveling along “The high deserts of California in June”, some problems arise. The heat from the pounding sun in the desert takes a toll on the cyclist causing him to drink more water and rapidly deplet his supply. The cyclist is also traveling through small “gost towns” rather than stoping at appropriate rest stops in order to refill with water and relax etc. Also while refilling he encounters hazards such as “Short rolling hills” through ghost the terrain and ever a snake. All of these features in the setting impare the cyclists ability to maintain confidence in wether he will make it to his destination and his positive attitude toward the journey etc."	2	3		3																					
6708	3	Cycling is a very good sport people who do cycling are in shape. Also they have strong calve muscles. I think its also dangerous as well.	1	1		1																					
6709	3	"In the story the author says, “The sun was beginning to beat down trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,” This gives you the idea that the heat is getting to him and is steadily depleting his water supply. At ore point he almost gives him self up to despair and dies of dehydration. It seems that he will never reach his good and he will continue to suffer in the grueling heat. I could almost feel the sweat and heat that the cyclist was feeling. Also, I could almost feel the lump in my throat when he says, “with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge a pebble in my throat.” The heat definitely effects this mans cycling in a bad way. He was exhausted and could not go on without water."	2	2		2																					
6710	3	The cyclist thought it was hard. Also he was upset that the old timers gave bad directions.	2	2		2																					
6711	3	"The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First, he couldn’t get water from anywhere because he was in a dessert with nothing but ramshackle sheds and rusty camps. Second, there were short rolling hills, and rough roads which made it hard to ride on. There were tumbleweeds in his way and large poisons snakes. The heat made it hard to keep riding. And there were no buildings structures of people around to give him a lift or water. That is how the setting affects the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6712	3	"In this essay by Joe Kurmaskie, a young man is baited into accepting outdated information by a group of old men. He pays for it later when on his bicycle, he is almost killed by heatstroke or dehydration. The setting is an excellent way to portray his feelings of hopelessness, despair, and fatigue. While he is just starting out, the road is flat and easy. It is cool and breezy. When he begins to run out of water, the terrain becomes bumpier and harder. He sees empty plains, cracked, dry ground, and the hot sun. He begins to despair even more. After a while when he thinks he can go no more he sees a store that once held gallons of grape juice. He laughs at the irony. The setting does do a wonderful job of describing his sense of helplessness."	3	3		3																					
6713	3	"In this pasage the cyclist was affected by the setting because if it had been any were else he would not have suffered or learned at all. Because the seting had botha lack of civillesation and water that he needed that caused him to almost faint of thirst.

6714	3	"The features of the setting in the essay caused the cyclist to suffer and continue being determined. The author of the essay used phrases such as ‘the sun was beating down” and “high deserts of California in June” to emphasize the extreme heat that caused the cyclist extreme thirst and heat exhaustion. The essay also says “short rolling hills”, “tumbleweeds” and “long, crippling hill” to describe the difficult terrain the cyclist faced that caused him to be tired and slower.

6716	3	"The setting in the story ""Rough road ahead” plays a great role on the characters journey. Some features that are mentioned in the story are heat, rough road, long crippling hills and a abandoned Grape Juice Factory. The heat in the story drives the cyclist into a dying thirst. @CAPS1 does her best to conserve her water through out the trip but the dry dessert heat doesn’t allow it. Then comes the rough road ahead. The cyclist trys to keep a steady and secure pass as @CAPS1 peddels along the bumps and breaks in the road. The long crippling hills are next in line the cyclist has to use all her energy to work up the hill. @CAPS1 wipes the sweat from her eyes to make sure its not a mirage and then @CAPS1 see’s it the abandoned factory. This is where the cyclist loses all hope for if @CAPS1 doesn’t receive water soon @CAPS1 is sure to be eaten by the birds. “Then, and easily as rounding a band, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. Gary and Wilber Fish Camp.” @CAPS1 rushed to the bathroom to drink the refreshing water to the sink pride and accomplishment overwhelm her."	3	3		3																					
6717	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it gives him the feeling of hopelessness. When the cyclist got directions to Yosemite from these two ??? old people, he thought he was getting a good shortcut. In reality, he was just led on a road that seemed to head nowhere where he saw many things that added to his feeling of hopelessness, for example, the author writes, “ I toiled on. At some points, tumbleweeds crossed my path and an adversely large snake. It really did move like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This shows that the cyclist is getting tired and seeing tumbleweeds, which usually represents a phase being completely deserted and deadly snakes that get in his way. This answers the question because it shows how the setting leads to his feeling of hopelessness."	2	2		2																					
6718	3	"The story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was a rough undergoing story about a cyclist going though rough climate and terrain. In this story the description was like a scorching path of nothingness for about as far for human eyes could see. In paragraph @NUM1 the text says “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could die from heatstroke.” is empressed how the climate felt.

And, if he would have gotten the water he needed because it was so hot, it wouldn't have been so physically draining on his body.

After he keep going the place that they told him to get water was very old and rusty and he pumped it he gaid tar came out. Than as he made his way in the dessert there way a snake came in the road he go around it. So never take advice from old timers.   	1	1		1

The author states numerous times the lack of water, and the rolling hills.

This also shows how he perserverd through his struggles and made an effort to finish."	1	1		1																					
6725	3	"The riders condition was rough, from flat land to rolling hills. This would be hard for some one who is dehydrating. There was a snake in his path so he went around it. This would be dangerous he could blackout from lack of water and then get bit by the snake."	1	1		1																					
6726	3	"The cyclist depicted in the essay is greatly effected by his surroundings. First, he described a beating sun and pines and rushing rivers. All these items are very animated things. The river is even described as rushing instead of, maybe violent. The setting is active just like the cyclist. Next, a ramshackle shed is acknowledged, as well as rusty pumps and a bad souding corral. When these old, forsaken things one mentioned, it can be noticed that the cyclist starts being a little in despair. And to tap that off, he drinks water that tastes like “battery acid.” Battery eats at skin just like the setting is eating at the cyclist."	3	2		3																					
6727	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” the setting is able to affect the cyclists emotions and moods in both positive and negative ways. As the author travels through the desert he is already upset because it is so hot and water is scarce showing how the terrain is a negative influence. Another example would be when the author first sees the old water pump and he is relieved showing positive influence but the pump oozes a shine like substance he referrs to as tasting like “battery acid” changing his mood for the worst. Finally, the pebbles he puts in his math show is desperation and willingness to try anything to survive show a new posotive outlook on the desert until a pump “lodges are in his thro at” making yet another negative influence. All of these feature lead him on his way to “Gary and will fish camp” and grounded an extra boost on his journey through the desert."	3	3		3

There was also a part where he got to a sign that said ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.The speed limit was 55 mph. He was doing a water a water - depleting 12 mph.

6729	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because where they were.It was like in te middle of nowhere and every person they asked are having all times.They go the wrong directions to the nearest town.The old guy told him it was @NUM1 miles down the road when he went @NUM2 miles to the next town and said to him self he will never take directions from a gut that has all timers and hasn’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office.	1	1		1																					
6730	3	"When the cyclist is in the “serenity of an early sunset evening”, the man enjoyed his cycling just hoping he could cut his time in half. Then, once he got the advice and headed down the road he saw a ghost town which is never good. Next he came to the fork and the town he came to had no water. On the way to the new town he came to the bumpy road and going @NUM1 he was out of water but finally after his determination he made it to a place that was very nice. So as you can tell the features of the scenery road affected him greatly."	2	2		2																					
6731	3	I think that the setting made him find more courage inside him self to save his water and go to the next town with out any water.	1	1		1																					
6732	3	"The environment affected the cyclist violently in the story “do not exceed posted speed limit” It seems that all of the harsh conditions of cycling in California all worn down this kid who took some faulty directions from older people at one stop. The heat and lack of water supply made the boy dehydrated. It says in the essay “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a georgus day in June simply because I listend to some gentlemen.” this explains on how simply exhausted he had become due to the miles of cycling, and the beating down sun and total lack of water due to absence of all towns. He came to the point of almost dying from heat exhausgen because of the faulty directions of the old people. Next time, he better make sure to keep extra water and stick to the map for directions."	2	2		2																					
6733	3	"As the cyclist makes his journey towards Yosemite, the setting causes him much worry and concern. In the beginning, the narrator is content and excited. He is doing something that be lovers, is heading for a beautiful destination, and has found a short cut to save him hours of time. He is confidentin the directions given to him by the old men. However, as he continues down the winding road, his environment makes him doubt theirjudgement. The first town he comes to is entirely deserted.Though at first he laughs it off, he laster realizes just how much trouble he in if he didn't come to a civilization soon. The cyclist runs across ""ramshackle shed[s]"" and shut down factories, and as his water supply sinks lower, the road seems to tantalize him. He passes a water pump (just what he needs), yet the water is something close to toxic. A road sign reminds him not go too fast, though he @MONTH1 die if he doesn't pick up the pace. He is forced to look at a picture ofa happy boy guzzling grape juice as he dehydrates. All there features of the setting, in addition to the overpowering heat and sun, drive the narrator to the breaking point.      "	3	3		3

Not only having a chance to be killed of dehydration or being ran over. Riding bike is really hard work when having to ride in hundred degree weather. Drinking drink after drink never having any water. No water and it being so hot could cause a heat stroke. As road get worse chances get higher tumble weeds and snakes in the way, he was determined to win. After all was said and he faced the horror that nature brought him he knew he was wrong wrong for them and the intelligants."	2	3		3																					
6736	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. The fact that he was in the California desert and the heat affected him because he had limited water and was using his energy riding the bike. The “towns” he came across also made an impact on him because of the fact that he couldn’t get more water or a place to rest. “I was doing a water depleating @NUM1 sometimes life can feel so cruel”. This shows how the hilly terrain and dehydration and heat are affecting the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
6737	3	Two of the biggest setting in this story is the desert and rolling hills. This would effect the rider becaus of the dehydration that he would experience. Being in the desert would make it obviously hot so you sweat alot and the hills would make it tough on your body because you put extrat strain to get up them. So all together this would be a hard bike ride.	1	1		1																					
6738	3	"In the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist experiences dehydration on his journey. The cyclist takes directions from older guys who look like they haven’t left their porches in ages. He takes their advice and he then sukkers in the long run because he cannot find water and it is a hot @DATE1. He hikes uphills in the heating sun and fears a heat stroke. There was no sight, not a building, car."	1	1		1																					
6739	3	"The setting will either effect the cyclist in a good way or a bad way. In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie it affects the cyclist in a bad way and a good way. In the story, it continues to talk about lack of water. “When I tried a drop or two it had the flavor of battery @NUM1). This shows that the heat made the water warm, so it did not cool him down. But a good way it affect them is pebbles. ""I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to @NUM2). This shows that even though he has no water the pebbles can make him less thirsty. This is how the setting affects the cyclist. In good way and a bad way."	1	1		1																					
6740	3	"In this story it is clear how difficult the cyclists journey is. He has to conquer wrong directions, lack of water, rattle snakes and fear of dieng. However he shows great determination and control. An example of his determination is “The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. “This shows his determination that he feels he can go on such a long journey. An example of his self-control is shown in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. When finding this building to be abandoned, and all things, juice, anyone use would have become frustrated and wanted to give up. But not this cyclist he controlled his anger and again showed determination. And it paid off in the end he found his water and survived. This story is a great story that shows determination and self control."	2	3		3																					
6741	3	"Early in the morning, the cyclist is eager and ready to face the adventurous path that had been mapped out by the older travelers. He hardly noticed the “sun was beginning to beat down.” He was calm and was looking forward to the “cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” Never once did he imagine what he had gotten himself into. As he began to approach the desert, he noticed he was running low on water. The strenuous activity of biking combine d with the scorching heat of the desert began to take effect. The cyclist was so desperate for water that he had to put pebbles into his mouth. He had once read, “that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.” The cyclist was hoping for a way out of the misery he had come across. Dehydration took it’s toll, and he felt hallucinations. He was beginning to lose hope. The heat and the hills and the lack of water had the greatest affect on the cyclist. Had he not been riding through a hilly desert one afternoon in June, he would have been fine."	3	2		3

The road weren’t the most comfortable to be riding on. In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the path to Yosemite National Park greatlly affected the cyclist. One the way to the park the cyclist came across a big snake that covered the road which greatly frightened the biker. Also the roads were long and very bumpy and windy. The road weren’t the most comfortable to be riding on. There was nothing insight for the cyclist to see. The cyclist did not have much energy because he had no hope for him. The author states, “…  gaining elevation while loosing hope.” Last the weather was hot and dry which tired the cyclist out. He had no water with him and with the weather he had no energy or hope to help him through the journey to Yosemite National Park."	2	2		2																					
6745	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit the cyclist expirenced a few life threating times during his adventure. The first feature was when was in a deseret with temptures of @NUM1 degrees and his lit bit of water tasted like battery acid. As he tried to keep going he lost hope and thought he was going to die. This affected him because as he lost hope he thought more negative about things and didn’t think he would make it but the he got the agility to move on. In this story the setting affects the characters dramatically.	2	2		2

An example of this would be the line, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California.” This line shows that the author was in a very hot place, being in a desert, but also that he has a low water supply. These two conditions are what cause the climax, which is the possibility that he could collapse at minute from heat exaustion. This is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.

6748	3	"Certin features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he desribes he’s experiences when he cycled through the desert. ''...arrived at the first town''...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town. ''at first the cyclist was amused at this town and maybe a little scketle at it because the old “codgers”  told it to be thriving. Halfway through his journey the stated ''sometimes life can be so cruel.” Water was running low and he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end. All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist. The ghost town and the lack of shade or soluation are very features of the setting that make that cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from older men.        "	3	2		3																					
6749	3	"I am going to explain how the setting of the cyclist affected him. The setting of the cyclist affected him by making him very hot & drinking his water & he would soon run out of water & dehydrate. For example in the story the cyclist would always bring up the little bit of water he had left & around the essay he talked about the dehydration he was seeing & even death. Another example is the relif he had when he drink the water from the sink. In conclusion, this is how the setting affected the cyclist."	2	2		2

6751	3	"The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist in many ways. For example it states “This place might have been a thriving little spot before the last world war it fit the tradition definition of a ghost town.” This statement is talking about town he arrived at when he was trying to get to Yosemite. This would affect the cyclist because he was riding in confidence in the beginning but then the first town he arrives in looks like a ghost town, which would bring his confidence a little bit lower than before. Just like when people travel when they know where they are going they feel good, but once they come to a place they know then they wont feel so confident. Another example is when he has to ride on rolling hills, and then comes across a “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” sign. This would affect the cyclist because then he would be frustrated and stressed out because he rode all that way and not he cant go any further, and that is not the place he wanted to be at. Therefore the features of the setting in “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist."	2	3		3																					
6752	3	"The conditions that the bicyclist faced that affected his trip were various amount of things that could really screw your ride up. Some of the conditions were hot It was very hot and that makes it hard to think fast, move fast and make good decisions another would be there was lose gravel and that makes it tough to maneuver and you have to watch your speed. So he’s not going anywhere in a hurry. also there were lets of hills and that makes for an uncomfortable ride and a tiring one atthat. Adding to that he was fresh out of water and that can mean dehydration again bud judjment and even heat stroke or exoustion another bad thing is he was in the middle of nowhere so its not like he could stop. Some where we asks for a drink to, there was nothing around for miles. These things show how rough the rode was made because these conditions exsisted."	2	2		2																					
6753	3	The setting was very hot dry and was a desert. This setting effected him be it was making him very dehidarted and hot.

6754	3	"The setting affected the cyclist because they were in California in June traveling back rodes, with no place to stop for water, if the cyclist would have followed the path they intended on following the ride probably have been more enjoyable and he/she wouldn’t of had to worry about a heatstroke or running out of water, they would have been fine."	1	1		1																					
6755	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. There were hills and rocks, snakes and no buildings or people. The hills and rocks would make it much harder to to stay strong and be able to keep riding. The abandoned building and there being no people, could affect him emotionally. It would make him loose hope and the determination to keep going to find destination. He did not think he would get that after seeing a deserted town. After all, he did say, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die … “(Kurmaskie)."	3	2		3																					
6756	3	The main features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the fact that it was June and the dessert heat. “… I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June….” (kurmaskie @NUM1). This helps us realize how bad the heat is in June in the middle of California dessert. This affected the cyclist by his dehydration and the fact that he was inthe middle of no where with no one to help him. This is how the month of June and the dessert heat affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
6757	3	"The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in this story. First, when he got to the road sign that said “Rough Road Ahead” he was already low on water, but that made things much worse. The rough road made it harder for him to pedal; therefore, he was working harder and getting thirsty. Also, when he stopped at the old Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, he noticed some pebbles on the ground and shoved them in his mouth. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing spit you have left to circulate”. Lastly, “GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP”, could possibly have saved the cyclist’s life. He stopped there and finally got a well deserved drink of water to settle his dehydration and fear.

In the beginning of the essay, the author is confident and happy, and the setting is, “a reservoir camp ground outside at Lodi, California” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This sounds like a good place to be refreshed and to feel confident. Later into the bike ride, the author is affected negatively by the barren area he comes to when he says, “This sight was troubling"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Finally when he reaches a modern store, he is relieved due to the modern facility when he states, “Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me” (Kurmaskie @NUM3).

6760	3	"“At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path..” being out in the desert with limited or no water can make one feel like life is very cruel. The sun was beating down and no water or shade is seen when he reaches a point. The sign that said “Rough @CAPS1 ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” had to be intimidating. Considering he was on a bike he could only move so fast. Those old men probably were never off their front porch since carter was in office. yes like the writer said “the world is a fluid place.  Things  change.” The old men probably had close to no due what they were talking about considering things have changed since @NUM1 (when carter was in office). The snake that he came upon, must have been rather intimidating. Knowing there is a creature like that, there is bound to be more.

6763	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. When she was riding it was very hot this caused the cyclist to lose energy and dehydrate. Also when the cyclist went through a terrain change. The road changed into rolling hills. This caused the cyclist to become tired because after riding up and down your body gets tired. Also being as the weather was so hot this caused the cyclist to drink a lot of water. Eventually she ran out and then got dehydrated. This whole situation implied to stick to your original plan.

Also in the text, when, “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view,” hope was replenished into the cyclist. This hope allowed the narrator to because more tenacious about his journey in order to arrive at the old building.

When the cyclist encounters a rough terrain with tumble weeds and snakes, he is both mentally and physically exhausted. He begins to doubt his consciousness and worries that he @MONTH1 not complete the journey. The abandoned grape juice factory is also a let  down for the cyclist’s mental state.

When he sees the fist building because he fist is relived but soon after he loses all his hope because it is desserted.

6770	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist in that a desert-like temperature and the terrain on which he must bike make him more prone to thirst and exhausting. The heat @MONTH1 cause the cyclist to dehydrate faster than normal. This is especially true in this case because of his lack of water. The cyclist might pass out or suffer a heat stroke. The terrain of rolling hills will tire out the cyclist quicker than if he were still on the flat road. His muscle will start to ocha and his body will need water and rest. The story would totaly change if the setting were different. If the cyclist were biking in the @DATE1 on a cold day in the mid @NUM1 he would not have a chance of suffering a heatstroke. There would be a significantly less chance of him becoming dehydrated. The setting is very important in every story and can change everything.	2	2		2

He has to ride up and down small and large hills through what he believes is a shortcut to his destination. He has a limited water supply, and he keeps coming cross ghost towns, where the only water is boiling brackish water that is unfit for human consumption. Probably the worst setting feature for this guy as the Welch’s Grape Juice Factory (abandoned of course). Adding salt to the wound was “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen” (kurmaskie @NUM1). To the narrator with his dwindling water supply, this billboard was especially daunting to him on his journey."	2	2		2

The cyclist reveals this when he describes, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,” aid againg  It read: Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly, He had thought that he would have stops on the way to get water from. So he drank all the rate he wanted. He then figured out the needed to conserve it but by then it was too late.

Another feature that could affect the cyclist is grass on both sides of the road. If he tireds to take a short-cut and goes into the grass he could he could hit a rock and flip off his bike and get hurt.

For example, he listened to some old people who led him the wrong way and could have had him killed. He was running out of water and his legs felt like they were going to break off. All of these troubles did affect his trust in old locals though. He learn that just because they are old and looks wise they have information probably older than the artifacts at a museum. Besides he has a trust map: He got a lot from this trip."	2	2		2

6779	3	The setting in  “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” adds drama into the story by how it affects the cyclist. He was tacking through the “high desert of California in June”. June is a hot part of the year and since he was in the hottest desert part the hot was multiplied. The terrain changing into “short rolling hills” didn’t help the cyclist. The hills would make any riding more difficult. Anyone who ride a bicycle knows it takes more effort to go up a hill than on a flat pavement. With the person lack of water anyone would be struggling to keep riding on. Most people didn’t have that hints to keep moving. He didn’t set a very goal he just went to the “next Horizon”. Shouldn’t he just wanted to keep going. Another problem with the physical environment was the road conditions. When the “Rough Road Affect” sign appeared the travel then become more difficult. A bike tire take more effort to go over uneven pavement is why the cyclist had so much trouble.	3	3		3																					
6780	3	"In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affected the cyclist in a hard way. With only a few sips of water left he said'' … abandoned years earlieR, by the looks of it it had been a @CAPS1 Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of Juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head.'' When only having a few drops of water and seeing that would have increased my thirst more. Another way the setting affected the cyclist in a hard way was "" The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. sometime ife can feel so cruel.'' This remind him that hes not in a car, and that hes not even going half the speed limit. The setting affects the cyclist by reminding him how long his journey is, and now at this point he is suffering."	3	2		3																					
6781	3	"In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead:Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting the cyclsit is in effects him greatly. One evening when he was resting he got into a deep conversation with a couple of elders. Eventually they got to talking about his journey, and the two men gave him direction for a shortcut. “But on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” When he arrives at the first town, he finds it deserted, this effects the cyclist because has eventually going to need more water. As he continues, he comes to a slep in the road. “After I had arrested the first few of these a large highway sign jumped out at most read:ROUGH ROAD AHEAD:DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” This sign was indicating that the road was going to be bumpy, which makes it even more challamging for the cyclsit. So, the setting is very important in this essay because it has a lot to do with how the cyclist feels. When the abandoned towns come into pray, no enging to feel hopeless. When the road get bumpy, he gets tired. When he gets to an actual running store, he’s relieved."	2	2		2																					
6782	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because the features is just a brief preview of what the text is going to be about or who is involved in it.

6783	3	"In the story, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" by Joe kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting of a story is the background, place, and time the story took place. In the story, a cyclist needs to get to @CAPS1 Park. He stops and gets direction from a group of old men, who aren’t up with the times, and the cyclist gets lost. He faces drought, a snake, and being lost in the desert, the cyclist says, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake – it really did look like a diamond back – blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, to"	1	2		2																					
6784	3	"The cyclist choose the worst time to ride his it was an “early summer evening” in California. At this time the sun is hot and with little water and also lost, it was hot the best choice that he made. A cyclist before do a trip he or she should be prepared for whether conditions and also check a map of the place before going anywhere. "	1	1		1																					
6785	3	"The cyclist run into a diamond headed snake, is out of water and is in the middle of nowhere the thing I would do is find some rope or cord time old building or tree and hang myself for taking directions from old people  that havent left their porches since carter was in office."	1	1		1																					
6786	3	"The features of this particular setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. Upon arriving at the “ghost town” early in his journey, he felt slight amusement at the situation. But he soon became very troubled when he became aware of the several rusty pumps and a weak corral, next to a ramshackle shed. The cyclist additionally experienced a bit of irony as he approached the 55 mph speed limit sign complete with a warning to strictly obey it. On his bicycle, at a pace of 12 mph, he could not even reach the 55 mph speed if he had wanted to. Before he reached what appeared to be an abandoned welch’s Grape Juice factory, the cyclist felt this twisted amusement yet again, as he laughed. The text states, “It was a sad hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” @CAPS1, his suffering was through when he discovered a “fish camp,” with a modern bathroom and working sinks. The cyclist’s relief was so immense that he,” had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber (the owners), (and) kiss them."	1	1		1																					
6787	3	"The setting of this story takes place with a man biking and then taking advice from old timers to a faster route. The biker knew from the start that he should have not given his map. But thinking the old folks knew the route he took theyre advice. What the biker should have done was look for someone to ask and make sure the route would work. But jumping to where he wanted to go led him to dehydration and much more struggle than needed. You should always think things out before you take action, just to be safe."	2	1		2																					
6788	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he first didn’t know where he was going and took directions from people that he wasn’t really sure about. It was hot he was running out of water he had no idea where he was there were snakes. His water was running out. there were no sings he kept thinking that he would never take directions from an old guys and that he would stick to the future.	1	1		1																					
6789	3	"At first when he gets the directions from the old men, he thinks he will be fine. When he gets to the first town he’s tired and almost out of water, but still thinks he will be in Yosemite soon. When he gets to the water pump in the middle of the desert, he’s tired and thirsty and he realizes that the directions the old men gave him were out of date. He’s really not happy about listening to them and not following his map. When he gets to the fishing place he is greatful for the water in the sink and for the rest and when the old man offers to give directions to Yosemite he thinks he will just use his map. Throughout the story the cyclists needs change from feeling confident to feeling depressed to feeling relived."	2	3		3																					
6790	3	"In the story ‘Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the setting seemed to affect the main character (the cyclist) very much during his pedal, for example, whole the dry desert setting made him think that he could survive with out water, he became dehydrated. The first town, with @NUM1 degree watter could not satisfy his standards. The old velches June factory, was all run down, and is no longer in business, much like the desert, just old barren unuseland. While yes the cycalist survived the pedal, the desert setting opposed a great challenge for him. "	2	2		2																					
6791	3	"There are many features of the setting that effect the cyclist. One feature is that it is getting hotter and it will eventually effect him. The line “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirge.” shows that the heat  might be starting to effect him. Another feature is that he is in the desert and running low on water. The line “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly” shows that he is drinking a lot of water and is running low. Another feature is that he is riding in the high deserts of California in June. The story says “and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Not only is it in June, but it adds heat because he is also in a desert. There is no doubt he will get dehydrated. Those are some of the many features that effect the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6792	3	"The setting affect the cyclist because it creates that deserted atmosphere and helps set the mood of the essay. The mood of the essay I think is a sort of dry summer day, the sort of “oh my gosh, its really hot,” type thing. The setting is a dry summer day in June, with a deserted town, tumble weeds and more to contribut to the hopeless feeling. Although he was secured, and didn’t die, it seemed like he would surely not make it judging by the lack of water, scorching hot sun, and distance, with enduring these conditions. So the setting affects the cyclist in a way that could have killed him."	2	2		2																					
6793	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because the old guys had worn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. So the features affect reading the story “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit” was very dangerous and unsafe for people to ride on.	1	1		1																					
6794	3	The setting effected the cyclist because it was bumpy and had a lot of hills which means he has to work harder. Also because of the heat he was getting dehydrated in the story after the cyclist had Been rideing a long time it says “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state “(kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist had very little water for his long trip	2	3		3																					
6795	3	"The way the features of the setting affect the cyclist I think is disgardment. First of all, a reason would be because at the beginning of the story when the warning sign is passed, the cyclist disgards it by going down the hill anyways. Also, it states that it “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.”"	1	1		1																					
6796	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he went through many ups and downs. At one point flowed by blackish watter feeling somewhere in the neighbor of two hundred degrees.. weather wouldn’t cool down.	1	1		1																					
6797	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they caused him to need water. He was worn out because the setting was so intense. “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” This quote from the text shows that the cyclists terrain was changing and they affected him."	2	2		2																					
6798	3	"The features of the surrounding landscape affect the cyclist both physically and mentally. First, the sun constantly beating down on the cyclist causes his or her body to sweat more, which makes one’s body use more energy. The sun rays also add to the heat the cyclist feels. Also, the rough road forces the cyclist to pedal very hard, which drains him or her of even more energy. For example, when the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” reached the rough roads, he had to pedal harder, which made him sweat more, and caused his amount of energy to decrease. Finally, the lack of civilization can make a cyclist feel hopeless, which is how the cyclist in the essay felt when he had no water or could see no nearby town. This can affect the cyclist’s will to keep pedaling, and if they have no determination, the cyclist will not go anywhere. The features of the setting can physically exhaust and mentally strain the cyclist, which makes it harder for him or her to keep going"	3	2		3

6800	3	"The setting acts as a catylist in this story. It is the aspect of the story that is always challenging the character untill the very end. In the story it says “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is showing that the terrain is opposing him. Also in the story it says “The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water depleted 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cool.” This is not only showing how much the elements are owning him it also shows how is risle he is, and how satiricle life can be. The ultimate @CAPS1 in this story is when he stumbels across the welches grape juice factory and there was a piture of a boy ""pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.” No matter where the cycalist goes he is alway trying to overcome the elements."	2	3		3																					
6801	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the lack of water begins to take a toll of how fast he can get to the next town. Another example would be the terrain only slows him down more.	1	1		1																					
6802	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him use up the last of his water because it’s hot, and than theres no one around because he's out in the deserts of California. “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage…” (@NUM1.). This exert from the test supports my previous statement about how it’s hot because the speaker tells us how he’s sweating and that he might be seeing a mirage. “There was no one insight not a building, car, or any structure of any kind” (@NUM2.). This shows that there is no one around to help him if he falls down from a heat stroke or anything like that. So the setting is affecting the cyclists endurance."	2	2		2																					
6803	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it more difficult to ride. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” “a large highway sign jumped out atm.” “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit.” “sometimes life can feel so cruel.” The fact the it was such a hot day made the ride seem longer. When out of water you feel exostied. You will do just about anything to try to with stand the heat."	2	1		2																					
6804	3	"Author Joe Kurmaskie learns the dangers of a lifeless wilderness during his experience described in “do not exceed posted speed limit.” As a cyclist riding in one of the most undeveloped areas in California, the lack of water found in this setting proves crippling to his survival. The trails he was directed to had no towns or sources of fresh, drinkable water for days. The combination of constant exercise riding through the terrain, lack of water and recources, California summer weather and lack of civilization trained the author’s energy and caused him to suffer from dehydration. Too much exposer to these conditions could have killed him. The modern time period and year also caused the directions the author were given to be in accurate, and, thus, causing the cyclist to find him self in such a dangerous area of the country. The setting of “do not exceed posted speed limit” places the cyclist in a life threatening situation."	3	3		3																					
6805	3	"The features of a setting could be a number of different things. It could be snowing and cold, raining and of course wet, hot and dry, breezy and humid. The features could be a busy tough or a solitere country road, there could be rough terrain or straight aways. The setting of a place puts pressure of the reality of what will happen on a cyclist. In the essay a young cyclist takes advice from some elderly man and ends up riding through hot sun and ghost towns not knowing if he would survive. The heat had him feeling as though death were coming on him and the thirst had him becoming more determined to get to the next town so he could survive. If the features of the setting had been different, say he was riding on a flat road in a busy town with a breeze and places to stop for water everywhere he would not have feared for his life. The features of the setting affect how the cyclist feels and thinks. He can feel angry, happy, sad or scared and he can start to think about his own death. These have been what I believe some of the effects settings have on cyclist."	2	3		3																					
6806	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example when the author says “flat roads were replace by short rolling hills”, that made the author have to ride safer. Also, when he says,” the ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement.” The author had to slow down on his bike and find a safe way around it so he could get past. Finally when the author says “no one in sight”, no building, car, or structure”, he is affected because he can’t ask questions since hes lost and hes thirsty. The setting makes it hard for the author to maneuver and get to where he wants to go."	1	2		2																					
6807	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the person who rode the  bike was very tired his legs and body needed a rest after riding on his bike for @NUM1 miles into the pedal. Also it effected the cyclist because of all the riding he had to do struggleing to get where he was trying to get but he was a strong man and he was willing to finish his forty miles of pedaling. He was also restless but he did it.	1	1		1																					
6808	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” because it goes to many different terrains. The cyclist starts at a town and his working his way to Yosemite when he decides to listen to a group of old men. He started out strong until he got to the first town, which was totally abandoned. He kept going to another abandoned town. He decided to keep going until he saw a sign. The terrain was a lot diffrent with rolling hills and tumbleweed rolling by and a snake. Through listening to the old men the cyclist almost died from the threatening heat and lack of water. The setting affected the cyclist even more seriously than he could have imagined."	1	1		1																					
6809	3	"In the story, the setting greatly effects the attitude of the cyclist. When he starts out, it is an early summer evening, he is serene while he is talking to the old men. He starts cycling the next morning and he is thinking of Yosemite, he is relaxed and confident however, his attitude about the day changes greatly when he comes across the rumshackle old shed, rusty pumps, and a corral at the park in the road. He becomes a little worried but he is not discouraged. When the terrain changes, he is a little discouraged. Then, when he comes across the abandoned factory, he is most definately a lot discouraged. A little later he comes across @PERSON1’s Fish camp, he is very relieved and thankful to the owners. The cyclist’s attitude changed depending upon whether the setting was very beneficial to him or not."	3	3		3																					
6810	3	"The features of the setting have a great affect on the desperate travels of the weary cyclist. The sometimes disappoint, sometimes uplifting, scenery he passes affect him physically and emotionally when he passes a portrin the road with nothing but a “ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral…” he becomes disturbed.  The cyclist is running low on water when he becomes even more distraught at a road with a speed limit posted as 55 mph, when he was, “doing a water-deleting @NUM1.” The setting of the hot, June sun affects the cyclist and puts him in a state of dehydration. In an, “ironic twist” the cyclist is affected emotionally when he passes a @ORGANIZATION1 factory that has been abandoned. The factory features a picture of a boy pouring a glass of juice into his mouth which upsets the thirsty cyclist."	3	2		3																					
6811	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist more than anything in the reading of “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speeding Limit.” In the beginining when the cyclists had just begun his cycling cause he uses a positive tone to describe the setting. For example, in paragraph four he says “the cool pines and running rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. “ When he says this the reader imagines someone in an ??? more excited as ??? ??? ??? ??? his destination on a dry day.  As the cyclists attitude becomes lower the reader makes the connection what ?? ?? then because of the setting. In paragraph thirteen when the cyclist says, “I wiped the swear from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage and that not to get too excited” the reader can make the connection that it is getting pretty serious for the cyclist to continue as is. Overall as the setting changes to “burning sun” and extremely hot, with a shortage of water the cyclist becomes more sarcastic and less upheat. For example when taking about the rocks in his mouth he states “with only luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” This shows a bad mood affected by the features of the setting."	3	3		3																					
6812	3	"The raugher the road gets for him the more determination he has at the beginning towards the end he had the mind set that, “it didn’t matter it was going to die, “this took a toll on him and it was hard to go on. He realyed he didn’t want to die that way and so he kept on, eventually leading to civilisation.   "	1	1		1																					
6813	3	"The feature of the setting affect the biker a lot because the rough terrain is described which implies that the biker probably had a hard time half way through the story he said, “Flat road was replaced by shor, rolling hills.” He said this to describe the difficulty in this race. It also makes it seem exciting because it changes things around. It wouldn’t be exciting if they said that flat roads turned into even flatter roads, or if they didn’t show the terrain change at all."	1	1		1																					
6814	3	"Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” an essay written by Joe Kurmaskie, is about a solo cyclist going on a journey to Yosemite National Park. So he listens to a group of old guys and ends up lost on rough road with no water, or relylittic supply of flat road was replaced by short rolling hills large highways lon jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” The rough road made have to work harder want more water and just made things tougher more than what they already were."	2	2		2																					
6815	3	"The settings of your environment always seem to affect your mood. Take for instance the cycler. In the beginning he had a positive attitude but once he arrived at the first town his attitude started to go down from there. He explains describes the town as maybe at one point being a thriving spot, “but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” Ghost towns come across very old, run down and dull. That affected the cyclist because by it not being like the old men said he was becoming doubtful, which in turn doesn’t give you the same motivation as when he started. Then when he get to what is suppose to be water and a, “tar like substance oozed out.” That makes him nevers and mad because he isn’t sure he will make it. But his attitude changes as soon as he sees the store. The setting becomes positive and so does he. So, the setting does effect the cyclists mood and attitude."	2	2		2																					
6816	3	"Many of the settings features affect the cyclist. One of the features of the dessert like, which is the setting, is the dry air and hot temperatures. This heat made it had for the cyclist to keep going, with despair the author says, ”I was going to die and the birds world pick me clean.” @CAPS1 feature of the setting was the desolet towns that didn’t contain any water. This lack of the water made it horrible for him to continue on. The thirst was so bad that he had to put pebbles in his mouth to sucking on stones helps take your and off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulates. @CAPS1 features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the abandoned Welch’s Grape factory. This  factory gave the cyclist false hope because it would have been so great to have some grape juice during his thirst stricken state. The narrator called the factory.”Ironic  twist.”"	3	3		3																					
6817	3	"The effects from the setting that has an effected on me is that while riding on the bike in hot weather with only a little bit of water to drink because I would have giving up have nothing to drink. The water had to be hot.In the text it sayed “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state”, I don’t think I could have lasted long, if I was dehydrated. From the look of it I would have drop dead of heatstroke."	1	1		1																					
6818	3	"Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance, in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the lack of water in the dry desert gave a long lasting affect on the cyclist. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” This shows the reader how all the heat and shortage of water has made the cyclist feel very hot dehydraded and that she could pass out any second. She is also thinking beyond that by just laughing at herself and trying to conserve every bit of energy she possibly can. As a result, the affect from the setting on the cyclist is that lack of water has given her humor and courage to keep going, to get to her final destination point."	3	2		3

6822	3	"At first the cyclist feels fine, he gets a little bit discouraged, but basically he’s fine. “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them” (@CAPS1). He feels relaxed, because he is at home with the water and the pine trees. They give him a sense of comfort. He thinks that after the first ""tree"" not being that much of anything, the others will be better. He knows that he has it in him to make it, but he doesn’t know yet that he will have to travel a long way to get water. When he sees the sign, “It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” he knows that things are going to get rough, because “the speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph”. At that point he starts to get worried, because he is out there more alone, and he realizes that he doesn’t have water. As he runs out of water, the landscape, and his surroundings, start to get drier and drier. He states, “tumble weeds crossed my path.” The landscape seems to get more threatening too, “a ridiculously large shake.” The landscape changes with the state of water."	3	3		3

6825	3	"Joe Kurmaskie’s “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” tells how a cyclist takes directions from older men who don’t tell him correctly the way to get to Yosemite, so the cyclist ends up lost with hardly any water. Features of the setting such as the terrain and the sun affect the cyclist in the story. The sun was very hot on a summers day and without water makes it even difficult to keep moving because he was so hot and thirsty. @PERSON2, “The sun was beginning to beat down… I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The terrain was also bumpy and rough to travel on. The sun and the terrain can affect the cyclist very much when out on a hot day in the summer."	3	1		3

Those hills really affected him physically he gets tired from peddling up and down continually. “that mood” was replaced by short, moving hills.” The cyclist could not er nuertecy tried everything, not showing how long he have to continue going up and down. There at one point he says, “@CAPS1 can feel so cruel.” There, he is upset because a road sign come up through acid tough roads, and told him not to exceed 55 miles per hour when he was fully going 12 miles per hour. This can be viewed as metaphorical also.

Also, the rolling hills exhausted him from working to cycle up them. This, also with the heat factor, caused him to use up his much needed water supply. The setting in this story deeply effects the cyclist. "	2	2		2

Bike riding on roads in the dessert with no trees or shade of any sort is quet harsh. And to be riding around where there is not much civilazation as to where you can’t get water is a major issue.	1	1		1

6836	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist because it was a hot June day in a desert in California. For example, your in the desert cycling for many hours very hot and only have limited water. This affects the author because you have to conserve the water that you have to be able to make it to the park. Anothe example, is that you are going up and down rolling hills and you legs get very tired so they don’t want to move any more. And the best example is the sun is beating down on you and your sweating so much and @MONTH1 be seeing thing but all you want to do is see something that has water. These are all things that affected the cyclist very much."	2	2		2																					
6837	3	"The cyclist in the story is running into a lot of problems in this story. For example, the cyclist is out in the summer heat in California riding a bike. After several minutes of this, you will become thirsty. The cyclist brought water but after constant sweating the water supply has nearly ran out. Not having enough water can cause a person to become deyhdrated which then can cause them to pass-out and possibly die. So as you can see, the cyclist is affected by the setting in the story. He has been affected negatively by the heat and by the lack of water."	1	1		1

Also towns were nowhere to be seen for it would be hard to substain life out there. This quote supports there weren’t many towns, ''About forty miles into the pedal I arrived at the first town.''This shows there aren't many towns in these parts, @CAPS1 so hot and thirsty as the text claims, ''I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst ''this clearly shows the  man wa very thirsty. Also shows the man was very thirsty. Also @CAPS1 so hot out there the man could see visions as the text states, ''As the looks ofter had been a grape juice factory and bottling plant.'' why would there be a grape juice factory in the middle of no where. Therefore these statements above show how settings can affect ones mind and physical conditions to the cyclist."	2	2		2

He drank his water at first with out thinking to much or it, but as he went on he slowly found himselfs trying to conseve it. By the time he got to the second wild town the will he was so thirsty and tired thathe thought it might of been a ""death"" So he wiped the sweat from his eyes."" to make sure it wasn't a mirage. The only time people see mirages is when the are hot,tired, and about to kill for some water.

This is said at the end of paragraph @NUM1: ,“and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The high deserts of California are windy, sandy, dry, and hot. Not something that someone should be cycling on, had the setting, told of the mountianous regions of California, the wither would hot be hot, or tired because the mountians are a cool, although dry place.

6844	3	"The features setting in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” are very important to the cyclist. In this story, the setting really affected the cyclist because it was in California which is a really hot place during the summer. The cyclist had problems because of the weather and on the shortness of water. Since there was a shortness of water he had to conserve it which slowed him down because he couldn’t ride as much. Although there was a cool wind and a river from Yosemite he had to pass quickly down the hill so he had even more problems.

As the narrator sas"" I was travelling throuhg the high deserts of california in June"" which is extremely not in california in June. The deserts hot weather made him eimited on water supply, and the fact that he was in the middle of nowhere, no buildings around makes him lose all hope for making it through. There were snakes in the desert which endagered him, and the bumpy road made it harder for him to hold on and get to somewhere. "" I began breaking the ride into distance i could see on te horizon, telling mself if i could make it treat i'd be fine.""

It’s like he’s on the countryside. So that makes him want to go faster, because he won’t hit any thing. The fact that he’s alone in the wide, open spaces boosts up his energy level and makes him feel more confident."	1	1		1																					
6847	3	"To be able to have a good bike ride, you must have a good setting. To me, a good setting would about @NUM1° outside and sunny. You can’t go bike riding in snow because there is no way that the tires will move in the snow. You can’t go in rain or hail because the roads get slippery and you could getin a accident that could injure or kill you. If it is sunny outside you be able to ride freely on dry roads with a little breeze to go through your hair and you could be refreshed. That is why I believe it is important for the setting to be just right for a bike ride."	1	1		1

In this story, the cyclist is heading for Yosemite National Park, thinking it wise, he accepts directions from a group of eccentric old men. He begins his journey confidently on flat terrain and with a large supply of water. The first of three promised towns had been resigned to that of a ghost town. The second offered only water that slightly resembled battery acid. The cyclist soon becomes exhausted from lack of water and having to cross the now hilly terrain. He barely makes it to the third town to realize that the juice factory was out of business. The cyclist becomes sure that he is going to die of lack of water when he stumbles across a bait store. If it hadn’t been so hot, if the “towns” along the way had offered better resources and if the terrain hadn’t been so hilly, the cyclist would have had a very enjoyable ride. All of the affore mentioned factors of the setting greatly affected the cyclist."	3	3		3																					
6850	3	"Hot, terrain, middle of nowhere- all are features of the setting that affected the cyclist. First, the hot weather in California made the cyclist thirsty and almost dehydrated. There was no place to stop for water and if there was, the water was bad and warm. Second, the different types of terrain made the cyclist really thirsty also and tired. Lastly, the cyclist was in the middle of nowhere. He couldn’t get water to hydrate himself or to sit down and rest."	2	1		2																					
6851	3	"The setting for the cyclist is a hard and dangerous one. He had little water, and his area had tough terrains. “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June” (@NUM1). He is dehydrated and he still has a long way to go. I went on a bike ride that was many miles long  in @LOCATION2, and we did not have water because we could not take a break. The terrain was tough, just like the author’s terrain. The camel he was in was affecting his brain, and he just wanted to get it over with. I am just glad I don’t have to bike in that terrain.

The only time that this cyclist found water was when it @NUM1 and tasting of battery acid. There was nowhere for him to find water for miles. This lack of water and scorching heat made him travel slow and wearily. He even says that he could only go 12 mph in a 55 mph zone. By taking the advise of the old men and taking a “short cut”, the cyclist past through ghost towns with no water. This “short cut” prolonged his trip, most likely by hours If he had gone through populated area despite the fact that it is a longer path, there would have been more water to drink, which would allow him to go faster. The dry, hot setting of the old men’s “short cut” made this cyclist’s trip last much longer than nessiarry."	3	2		3																					
6853	3	"When the man began cycling he thought that this was going to be an easy for ride. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says “Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” As he got further he realized that he was in the middle of nowhere. The scenery was getting more and more empty. There was eventually nothing. The scenery was putting down his hope of ever getting out of the desert. For example: In paragraph @NUM2 it states, “a large highway sign jumped out of me. It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” He realized this was going to be hard. He had to travel in bumpy roads and pass snakes without getting bit. The scenery created a sense of hopeless because it was abandoned. When he saw the bait shop, his spirits lifted and he was now hopeful and relieved."	3	2		3																					
6854	3	"When the cyclist began his journey he was confident in succeeding. Throughout the story however, the cyclist endures many conflicts to his successs in his journey. The cyclist faced his first difificulty once he reached a small, abandoned town. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist realized he had not conserved his water and his “water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (kurmaskie @NUM1). On top of his water problem the heat was unbelievable. He was losing hydration from all the sweat, and he was losing it quickly. The cyclist was also dealing with the difficult roads. There were many things this cyclist endured through-out his journey, but he was determined to finish his trip and was filled with satisfaction once he overcame these hardships."	2	2		2

The first thing would be listening to old men who seemed like they had no idea how far, long, or the condition of the roads where they were sending him. Another thing that affected him would be the road condition, where there were tumbleweeds, and a ridiculously large snake. The second thing that came into play would be the hot weather which made dehydration come into play."	2	2		2																					
6856	3	"One main feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is the heat of the day. If you ride a bike in the heat of the day, you are going to use up a lot of water.

The cyclist was in a very bad dehydrated state as he was riding his bike, looking for water or anything drinkable that would successfully get rid of his dehydration. After a little while, the cyclist found himself alone in the desert with no one in sight. An example of this would be “There was no one in sight,not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Another example to show how the cyclist was struggling and fighting against dehydration is “wise rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june simply because i listened to some gentlemen who haden’t been off their porch in decades shown how the settings of this essay affected the cyclist greatly."	2	2		2

The California desert is extremely hot and can be potentially dangerous depending on your situation the author was describing how the lack of water was affecting him. He described this with sentences like “Rattled around the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.” The author clearly cannot face the rugged heat with his immense lack of water. The author was getting neat stroke being passed by @LOCATION2  desert snakes and tumbleweeds. The author was clearly in a struggle against the @LOCATION2 desert heat."	2	3		3																					
6859	3	The settings and features are very important to cyclists one because water and food try might carry a waterbottle and a snack but they need to know  where they are going and if they will need to bring extra or not. In the story I just read he didn’t bring enough to last him so he got some directions but they were bad so he was in trouble. Its important that a cyclist knows where their going and whats around them so they don't get lost and have no acsess to food or water.	2	1		2

All of these things made him really tired for example he didn't have much water and the sun was making him hot and dehydrated. There was no shade so he had to just take the sun beating down on his back. He had to jump over hills so that took alot of energy. He had to ride up one long hill so that also made him tired. All of these things happened back to back without giving him a break, so it really tired him out."	2	2		2

Firstly, the cyclist had been pedaling through the “high deserts of California”, making a hint that the temperature was hot and dry, and therefore he must’ve been getting thirsty regularly and exhausted from the sun beating down on him. Second, he began to ride through hills, and as common sense would be used, hills are much harder to ride on a bicycle especially up hill, and it wears you down. These hills, along with a lack of water must’ve tired him out and given him extreme difficulty to make it without much water.

Another thing that affects cyclist is the smothness of the road they are riding on.

The environment of the hot June weather near a dessert area can cause serious problems, for example heat stroke and since he had no water to drink dehydration caused a lot of fear in the author. The setting of the essay and the conditions the author were under were extreamly dangerous and hes lucky he made it out alive."	2	2		2

6886	3	"In the short story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting greatly affects the cyclist. For example. In the beginning of the story, the cyclist is eager to get to Yosemite National Park. He listens to the advice of, old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their parches since carter was in office, “and quickly realized that he shouldn’t have. The author describes the setting of the first “town” as, “the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This didn’t bother the cyclist as much as his next sight. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and corral that couldn’t hold in the largest mule.” Was what met him there. The cyclist said that “this sight was troubling.” It is obvious that the cyclist has given up hope when he says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This short story shows how anything can get even the best of travellers worried about their survival."	2	2		2																					
6887	3	" I think the features of the settings affect the cyclist because the knowledge of the cyclist is limited example, “old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office”, meaning now its time for the older people to relax and watch of younger people."	1	1		1																					
6888	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because where he is riding it is very dry and hot. He can deal with the heat with his good water supply, but when it runs out he begins to get disoriented. For example in the text he writes “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirrage,” That statement shows that the cyclist was hot, and the images around him making him feel more hot than what he is, and his lack of water made him almost belive that he was imagining seeing a building. Another example is “A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hang my head.” This quote shows that the cyclist is in complete despair as he looks at the photo and hangs his head. This shows that the cyclist was constantly being reminded how hot and thirsty he was everywhere he would  go and he couldn't get a drink. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6889	3	"The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” greatly affected the cyclist in the story. “Not two miles into this next reaction of ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (kurmaskie). the cyclist is travelling through hot, dry California in the middle of June without much water left. The fact that he now has to travel up and down short hills is going to make him even more tired, because going over hills requires more energy, than flat riding. This energy, loss coupled with the cyclist lack of water causes him to become even more miserable. The setting of this story greatly affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6890	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist mood and behavior. First the cyclist sees from believing the shortcut will help him arrive to Yosemite faster then he relies it wont. Next, the harsh sun and rafh terrain and lack of water causes the cyclist to give up hope that he will make it to yosemite and causes him to rethink his judgement and taking advice from others."	1	2		2																					
6891	3	"The setting affected the cyclist in a harsh way. At first, the cyclist was fine and going strong, but soon after the first ""ghost town” he was getting weak. Then the cyclist had to face a few problems. For example he was running low on water. Also, he faced rough roads last, he faced snakes and abandonment. The cyclist had to face many obstacles, but in the end, he pulled through strong."	1	1		1																					
6892	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist for these reasons. It says “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral that couldnt hold in the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling.” That showshow how the features affected the cyclist because he says the sight was troubling. It  troubled him because he wanted water and he seen the rusty pumps that reminded him of water but he new their was no water or it was nasty"	1	1		1																					
6893	3	The conditions of the enviroment as well as the road can majory effect the cyclist. For example If some one was riding a bike in warm wheather on flat land it would not take major determination to pedal. On the other hand if it is hot and rough paths and hilly roads the biker colud dehidrate and it takes much more effort to get up and over the hill. Those five the conditions of the enviroment effect a cyclist greatly.	2	1		2																					
6894	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist, on his way to Yosemite National Park, is forced to face the rough deserts of California. As is normal throughout all deserts, the sun is blazing hot, as is the sand. There is no water anywhere and dangerous, highly venomous creatures are abundant. The lack of water almost puts him into a heat stroke as he is determined to leave the desert, riding his bike all alone. A grope juice factory taunts him, mocks him, but he continues on, with a steady pace. The desert roads are rocky and bumpy and his lousy 12 mph speed is getting him practically nowhere. Until, finally, he reaches a modern area and drinks from the sink in the bathroom."	2	2		2																					
6895	3	"In the story the setting plays a big role in effecting the cyclist. The terrain was very hard at times such a big hills and windy torns. Also, there was no one around. no houses, buildings or people which made him fell alone and life he was going to die. The author describes the terrain in one part of the story “Over onelong, crippling hill a building came into view! This quote shows how the hills in the seting were very big and hard to get over. It also shows the significance of a single building and how excited he was to see it. In the story the author described many features from the setting which all greatly effected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6896	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist, by putting him in unwanted places starting off with this man took advice from many older men, which don’t even know the area anymore. So riding through this man seems lost, he is trying to follow their advice, but comes across many unknown, unwanted areas. He starts out good, then comes to a “Rough Road” and he even says “sometimes life can feel so cruel”. Then he come to this large snake in the middle of the road scary enogth he has to slow ride past this thing taking up most of the road. Coming over these thing was very strong and hard of this young man."	2	3		3																					
6897	3	"The dessert environment had huge effects on the cyclist. He had been drinking his water regularly and would be running out. Not realizing, their would be no refills because the pump was only giving “ tarlike substance” said the text. With the lack of water dehydration was beginning to hit the poor man. An effect of dehydration is poor balance that would have been useful to pass the “ ridiculously large snake” he had seen. A finale effect would be mirages that could loose your judgement. This man double checked his eyes, when coming in view of a building, by “[wipping] the sweat from (his) eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage,” Through all the toughest desser obsticles the character was able to take the short cut and survive heat, dehydration, and animals of the dessert."	2	2		2																					
6898	3	"I think the features in the setting of the story ""Do not exceed the speed limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, highly affect the cyclist. Some implied a information would be that it is very hot out, and the people in towns didn't help him. I know that it is not because the text says,""somewhere in the neighbourhood of @NUM1 degrees."" This implies that it is very hot outside. I can tell the people in towns didn't help him because the text says, ""Never accept travel advice from collection of old-timers who havent left the confines of their porches since carter was in office. ""This shows that the people in towns didnn't help him. Some expressed information in this text would be that there is a rough road, and a shake was in his way. I know this is expressed because it tells you right in the text. ""Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. ""This comes right out and tells you there is a rough road.

6899	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a larger way, almost resulting in a very sevior situation. The cyclist was in a desert. Like terria, which was not dinsely populated on his trail, there was a lack of fresh water supplys, and the tempatures is more extreme. The cyclist could easily have faintid from heatstroke, due to the lack of water and excessive heat and work that his was doing peatling. Had the area been more populated, he would have had more chances to stock up on water greatly indecriasing his risk of heat stroke. There was also the snakes which presentid danger for him, has he been bitting then he would be at least @NUM1 miles from the closet help which could proven fetal. Had the setting been, say a city park, on a populated country side, them thi setting would had provided exponeutaly loss prodioms and dangers for the cyclist."	3	2		3																					
6900	3	"The conditions and features of the setting caused the cyclist to be tired and dehydrated and think that he was going to die from it. For example, it says “and ther growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a georgus day in June”. Also , he thinks he is getting dehydrated when he says “I  was doing a water depleting 12 mph. sometimes life could be so creul”. in conclusion, this cyclist started this without enough water causing him to think that he was going to die from either heatstroke or dehydration."	2	2		2																					
6901	3	The setting affects the cyclist because he’s in the middle of nowhere with no water. The cyclist had to ride his bike for over @NUM1 miles trying to get to Yosemite. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly.” This quote shows that he just beginning to run of of water. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This quote shows how he really had nothing to drink at all. Having no water in the high deserts of California while riding your bike for over @NUM1 miles is not a good @CAPS1 unless you have a car. 	2	1		2																					
6902	3	In the essay the setting had every thing to do with  the cyclist cause he is ridding through the desert with batey tay water. He is pedaling through the dry heat thats tough even you had water pluse there were hills deadly snakes.Its dangerous enough with out that stuff being there.

He described the terrain with “short, rolling hils.'' and ''over one long, crippling hill.''

He @CAPS1 realized once he encounterd these Features oF the terrain that he was oFF track and needed to find help.

6904	3	"“Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is an inspiring and almost humorous essay it take the reader inside a journey in a cyxlist daily routine. In this story the author fights dehydration as he tries to make to a national park with shortcut directions from “old timers” the setting of this storygreatly affects the cyclist and the pitty the reader feels for him. Half way through the essay, the biker had already traveled roughly @NUM1 miles; that’s extremely crazy. The fact that he is travelling through California deserts in June is even harder to believe. The first time he mentions the setting, he states he is in a ghost town, two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down. At that point he wasn’t really bothered. Another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” He was already dehydrated and had already traveled so far, the rocky roads probably didn’t help his journey much. The setting basically made the story. If he wouldn’t have been peddling in the desert, it would have just been another trip in his life. The setting makes the reader see what cyclist really go through. "	3	3		3																					
6905	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. It does because the road is not in good condition and he has to travel a long distance with the bad weather. This affects him because he might get dehydrated. In conclusion there are many things in the setting that affected the cyclist.	1	1		1

6908	3	The setting was the main affect on the cyclist. He said it was hot and that he was lost. The cyclist had no clue were he was going and it was hot out side. He seemed very strest and that only made it worse for him. He was thirsty from all riding and the heat so he trys to get water from a water pump. The water that was in it was horable. He called it a “substance” it had a flavor of battery acid. “If he were not lost and if it were cool outside he would have water and he would not be so upset. The setting of a hot and lost place had a huge impact on the cyclist.     	2	2		2																					
6909	3	"In my opinion the features of the selling affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when he was talking abut the terair changing from long strat roads to shard winday one and the speed limit changing he said.he was doing a waterdepleting @NUM1 fuier sands like he is having a hard time, or doesn'twnt to go on."	1	1		1																					
6910	3	"Due to the features in the setting, including the hot summer weather, the cyclist not knowing the area, and the California desert the cyclist is affected. In the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist is travelling through the hot desert in June when he realizes hes running out of water, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”(Kurmaskie). This is affecting the cyclist because hes becoming hot and has a low supply of water. Also the cyclist realizes he should have never taken the direction from the old men and thinks to himself, “…The growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June”(Kurmaskie). This quote proves that the heat of the desert is taking a toll on him."	2	2		2																					
6911	3	"The setting of this story affects the cyclist alot. I think the setting was supposed to be most like a run-down out of dated town which didnt help him when he was lost. The town is out of date and hot. Which bring another problem, the cyclist was dehydrating because he didnt have enough water. He would hilusinate and see things that werent there. He become very tired in the hot sun. So the setttling in this short stories effected the cyclist in many ways."	1	1		1																					
6912	3	The feature's of the setting affect the cyclist because the condition's he is in without any water. the cyclist would be fine if he would have had more water for his trip. He ran out of water not to for into  his journey thanks to the heat of the setting he was in. the cyclist makes this statement. I was hitting my water bottle pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June”. The cyclist is saying that since it is so  hot where he is he has to take regular drinks of water so he stays highdrated throughout is trip. It is also saying that in the mountians with less air and how hot it is he is not doing as well as he thought he would on the trip.	1	2		2																					
6913	3	"The cyclist had a hard trail to bike in order to get to @LOCATION1. It is easy to bike if you are on flat smoot terrain, when you get to rolling hills, it makes it a lot tougher. The biker said “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. It was also very hot. he was sweating and getting dehydrated, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind of thirst.” he had eighteen miles to next town without much water. The first deserted town didn’t have any drinkable water. It was very hard to bike in these conditions, and is important to always be prepared and know were you are going."	2	2		2

6915	3	In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1” the imagery is what sets the cyclist back. The scorching dessert and plant life gives him a sense of seclusion and scares him. Because the cyclist is in the  dessert he keeps on worrying about his water and heatstroke where as if he where in a rain forest he wouldn’t worry about water or heat. I think he siked himself out just by taking in his sorroundings. If the cyclist would have pictured water all around him and arctic like temperatures I think he wouldn’t have been so worried. What’s interesting about this story is that if he would have gotten himself prepared mentally for the conditions he wouldn’t have struggled so much at the end. “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back blocking the majority the pavement in front of me.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). If the cyclist word of concentrated more on the task at hand and less on what was going on around him I think he would of succeeded without as much stress.  	2	3		3																					
6916	3	The features  of the setting affect the cyclist in that it made him use up his water supply and tested his determination. “ Sometimes life can be so cruel” implies that he was having a horrible time coping with the setting he was in.

6917	3	"In the essay “Rough road ahead: do not exeed posted speed limit,” the author is continually depressed, by the features of the landscape he passes. At first he passes a ghost town, but because he has enough water, this sight doesn’t bothe him. But the next thing he sees is a rundown old shed and a “rusted water pump,” and this troubles him because he is running out of water. Then he sees a huge snake which does not help his mood, because the snake is blocking his path then he passes an abandoned Welch’s Grape Juice factory and despairs that he will never find water. The setting its features serve to dissappoint depress the cyclist in his quest to find water."	3	2		3

He is riding on the road; hopelssly hoping for some form of lif. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. “The author is trying to be positive but it’s hard, because all this scenery is doing is bringing his hopes down. How would you like it if you were riding a bike and had no water in the middle of a desert. Now, if the setting had been a nice, green forest, he wouldn’t be that worried, there’s water and shade.

6921	3	"Poor directions heat, and lack of water affect the cyclist in the story. At the beginning of the story, the cyclist is confident in the directions which would, “slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.”  As the story progresses, the cyclist is no longer so confident. The “heat of the California, June day causes him to be fluent in drinking water.” I had been hitting my water bottle pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” This lack of water is a big problem for the cyclist, so big that he was near heat stroke. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He braved the elements and forced himself on, with hopes that any source of water would reveal itself to him.

6922	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. I say this because the setting is in the hot deserts of @LOCATION1. The cyclist is sweaty and tired and has almost no water left.

Also, because of all the road conditions it was hard to ride a bike through all the rocky roads and he was very tired and dehydrated so that didn’t help him it just tired him more. Another reason is because of the poisonous snakes if he disturbed them they could harm him. Also, if he would had fallen off his bike a snake could have biten him and then he wouldn’t be able to make it anywhere because of the bite. Those are the features of the setting that affected the cyclist."	3	3		3

It affects him physically because of the rolling hills he has to trudge over and the lack of water he has. The rolling hills make him tired and weak along with the rough terrain. The lack of water doesn’t help any when he’s thirsty because of the hills. The features affect him mentally because the farther he goes the more dalerious he gets. Each more mile he keeps telling himself, if I can just get there I’ll be fine. He also blames himself for listening to the old men. And with this also came doubt. He was doubting that he could make it alive. In the story it says, “it didn’t really matter: I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean"". mentally he couldn’t make it."	2	2		2

As the cyclist prepares to retire for the day, he takes particular note of “the serenity of an early summer evening,” and ends the day feeling calm. The next morning he is excited and rejuvenated, ready to bike again. The heat rises as the day goes on, and by mid-day the cyclist begins to worry about his water supply. He boldly continues forth reaching new terrain, rolling hills. Here he begins to lose hope, and is disappointed when he seem the “town” he hoped to find is an abandoned juice factory.

He rubbed it off though, and kept “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite,” as his motivation. He pedaled on, but began to run out of water when he arrived at a well, he found the water to be inedible, and continued. Just as if things couldn’t get any worse his trail was getting rougher, and his water supply was low. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated, and began to lose hope. He became even more of a pessimist when “a ridiculously large snake- blocked the majority of the pavement…” He kept going, and excitedly pedaled toward a building, but found it to be abandoned.

His main opponent in the battle of staying alive was the heat. In the California deserts as a day in June. It was no surprise that the sun would be heating down particularlly harder than it would at another place anytime. Also, as the terrain became hillier, his journey became even harder. There is nothing hard about biking in a flat straight line. But constantly peadling yourself up steep hills and around winding roads is no picnic. Just like the buildings around him, the cyclist’s water deteriorated as did his state of mind as his trip which started out very joyful became increasingly more mardid. “It didn’t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.

This is an over whelming feeling because you can die from dehydration. She then kept cycling and saw nothing. “no one insight; not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” That is alatining no water or people around, as if you are going to be just left to die.

Then he didn’t ask someone elses apirean on where to go and how to get there. His worsed mistake tough was not trusting the map he had with him the howl time. If he would have just trusted his map and not when with when the old fella said he wouldint have almost died of heat stroke.	2	1		2																					
6936	3	"In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects him negatively because he was on his bicycle and he was in a hot area and no water whatsoever, like  in this quote, “I  got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance ozzed out.” In the quote, the cyclist finally thinks he has found a water pump but he really gets nothing. Also, another negative thing is that he thought he was never going  to get to where he was going, but in the end , he got there and he got some water."	1	2		2																					
6937	3	"The setting in the story affects the main character greatly because of the heat. The main charater is biking throug a desert in the summer with little water. The heat of the setting provides a problem because the main character is at risk of dehydration and heatstroke. The main character knows that if he passes out in the barren desert he will sarley die. The main character says, “The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” The main character is faced with a problem of man versus nature and the heat is winning. Heat and dehydration sap the main characters energy while he is biking through a desert, desperately trying to make it to the next town. In summary, the main characters biggest problem is the heat of the setting."	2	2		2																					
6938	3	"The setting around the cyclist affected him in one main way. “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first “town” (Kurmaskie). The cyclist put the words towns in to parentasis because it was actually a Ghost town. no on lived there, It was abandoned. Around the cyclist was deserts, and more empty towns. The father the cyclist got, the more we realized the old men were wrong as the cyclest was running low on water and there was no where to stop. He finally found some and vowed to never listen to old mens directions again."	2	2		2																					
6939	3	"All the feature of the area have a have a big affect on the cyclist. It is a hot June morning, and he is on his bike, pedaling hard, going many miles. He can't find any water, because all the towns along the road are deserted. He is getting dehydrated, and losing strerigth. It seems like he might have collapsed it he hadn't thought he was going to @CAPS1, and if he hadn't gotten some water at that store. All in all, the setting seems to have the intention of king him."	2	2		2																					
6940	3	"The features of the setting in “Rough Road:Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit”by Joe kurmaskie affects the cyclist in a very negative way.It begins slowly with the “ghost town”.The narrorator “chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on,” he wasn’t especially worried,but the fact he checked his water suggests that he’ll need to ration it for a while.The decline continues when he reaches the fock and the “ramshackle shed.”@CAPS1 the description of the place shows you he did not like it,and he confirms that with the words,“this sight was troubling.”He wouldn’t be replenishing his water here.Any more of this he’d be dead,either from dehydration or from pessimism.Eventually he reached the road sign which declared that going over 55 mph was a bad idea.This is ironics,he only going 12 mph to put it in his own words,“sometimes life can be so cruel.”He quite obviously hates the setting,and it’s all the fault of the setting."	3	2		3																					
6941	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he had limited water, he had to peddle harder to get up over the hills and he was getting dehydrated from the heat. For example, he had limited water because he had taken the directions from the old men and probably didn’t bring as much as he would have if he would have taken a longer way. Furthermore, to get up the rolling hills he had to peddle faster and harder. That affected him because he would have been more exhausted from peddling. Moreover, it was a June day and in June the days are hot with the lack of a good amount of water the cyclist would have started to get dehydrated. This is how the setting affected the cyclist"	2	2		2																					
6942	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For one, his body heat raised a good bit. They don’t come out and say it, but they do say, ”The sun was beginning to beat down.” We all know that it your out side when it’s hot, you get hot too. It also probably added to his dehydryeon. As a long distance running, I know what the sun will do to you during a hot day. That is how the setting affect the cyclist."	1	2		2																					
6943	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. For one, if the desert was not a deserted mountainous area, in California then the cyclist would not have the same problems. By changing anyone features of the setting you would change how the cyclist would behave in the setting. Thus changing the entire plot of the story. If the cyclist was say in the entry or a mere develop area then he would not face the same dangers as if he were in a mountainous region. The settings features have a huge affect on the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6944	3	"In the story “Rough Road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting seem negative to the cyclist. The setting seems to start worrying the cyclist two miles after he said that he could make the next @NUM1 miles easily. For example the cyclist says “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, “the cyclist seems worried at that point that things aern’t going to be as easy as they seemed they were going to be. From that point on the setting seemed to get worse for the cyclist later on the cyclist ends up saying “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” That was when the cyclist began to notice his fear of dehydration. The cyclist ended up making it and he realized what a big effect nature can have on you."	2	3		3																					
6945	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by unexpected things happening. His water supply got drank quickly and he couldn’t find a town near. He was in the desert-like California, and the sun was beating down on him. When he did one town, it was more of a “ghost town”, and had rusted pumps that had battery-oil tasting liquid. Every person he asked told him is near, but from dehydration, it took him longer. the roads got windy and small hills occurred. There was a large snack in the middle of the road, as the tumble weed blew by. the finally saw a town that had a bait shop and was able to get water and cool down.   "	2	2		2																					
6946	3	"The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit definitely affected the author. The cyclist states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist probably found it more difficult to navigate  through the ""hills"" as opposed to the ""Flat roads,"" making him more quickly tired. The speaker states, “I could drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The speaker is implying that it is so hot outside that he could faint from a ‘heatstroke’ which could slow him down. The speaker also states,""water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees""(Kurmaskie @NUM3). The author did not have any good water to drink, because it was so hot outside, which affected him in that he was dehydrated. Many aspects of the setting affected the cyclist.

6947	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if the old men didnt give the boy advice then he probably wouldnt have run into all the trouble he ran into. At the same time the boy made his way to were he was going. Next time though he will just use his map so he dont have to go through the scare of death again.	1	1		1

6949	3	"The setting of this short story has a big affect on the cyclist. Since the story takes place in the desert, the temperature is very hot. The cyclist only packed enough water for the intended trip. Since he made a few wrong turns, he ended up needing more water. There were no signs of civilization so he could not stop any where and buy water. He came to a “run-down” rusty fauret and tried to drink water from it, but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. If this short story had a different setting, then the story would not make much sense. For example, if the story would have taken place in @LOCATION1 he could have just stopped and bought water. The setting is one of the most important elements in a story."	3	3		3																					
6950	3	"The features affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the road, the rocks everything close. The cyclist needs to know everything about where he's going, because if not then he can run into some problems along the way, For example like snakes, rough terrain, rocks in the way. That why its important for a cyclist to never listen to anyone but themselves. That why when you see cyclist you see them around, a road where theres cars around, just in case they get into trouble."	1	1		1

6952	3	"At times when the features of the setting are bad it can have a great impact on the cyclist. For one if it’s too hot the cyclist is going to need plenty of water if he/she does'nt want to be dehydrated. There are also the dangers of heat strokes and deadly snakes, cyclist might want to avoid that. When your a cyclist times can be hard just prepared for the long run."	1	1		1																					
6953	3	"The setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” really goes against the cycilist and his journey. This is because in the places he goes there is no water and if there is it is really hot or bad water. For example, on page @NUM1 it says, “a tarlike substance oozed out, but the water wouldn’t cool down,” This explains how bad the water was when the cycilist was there."	1	1		1

6955	3	The feature of the setting included nice cool pines and than a gost town and it bein hot out and banser of @CAPS1 and posine snacks and hills that where getting harder to go up. When he first started the pines where nice and cool but when he scan the gost town he sot dischriced than it started to set hot and than he seen the snack and thout that it was a dimed baby and was nuvves and than he was carid of dehydration than the hills started to make it harder and harder that is what it was like.	2	2		2																					
6956	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he has to use more energy to pedal up hills and through rocky terrain. Therefore he drank more water. When he coudnt.	1	2		2																					
6957	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first was the terrain, which started out flat, then turned to hills. The cyclist was growing tired from all the pedaling. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This tired him out faster, since going uphill is harder than riding flat terrain. The heat definitely affected him, because it made him thirsty. He was “travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” This is a very hot time of year, and when a person get lost without conserving water, which he had not done, a person get extremely thirsty. Not to mention the “sandblasted picture of a young boy pourng a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,” which would remind the body of its thirst. So the setting most definitely affected the cyclist"	2	3		3																					
6958	3	"In the story, the cyclist iS greatly affected by the features of the setting. For example, the setting has no thing for miles. Just ghost towns, makes it imposible to find any water. Also it’s a desert like setting, adding to his thirst. Another example is the hills, that made him even more thirsty. It was June in California so it must have been pretty hot and also the town that he are to had no water because they seemed desorted. Another example is the state he put under his tongue. It’s a trick that lets you survive alot more effectively. Therefore the settings affected his journey and made him wish he didn’t take the old mans advice."	3	2		3																					
6959	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Three features I found were the lack of the water, the heat and the conditions and limits of the road. The lack of water really affected the cyclist. When he was died tried he/she didn’t have anything to drink. The essay stated how would say she/he would save the water til the end. He /she was so tired so the lack of water really affect him/her. The conditions he/she was in really affected the cyclist also. From the beginning he/she was told the wrong directions. That was the reason why he/she was lost the entire time. Finally the limits of the road affected the cyclist. Hills and different grounds did not help the cyclist. In conclusion, the cyclist had many factors affecting him such as lack of water, limits of the road and his/her conditions."	2	2		2																					
6960	3	"I think that the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, I think the weather conditions affect him. I think this because in the passage it says, “I could drop from heatstroke”. Meaning, its really hot! Also, l think the fact that he has no water left is affecting him because it says in the passage, “l eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state”. This has a big affect on him, because he’s very thirsty. Also, l think the fact that there is nothing around him is affecting him. I think this because in the passage it says there were no cars. I think all these things affect him."	2	2		2																					
6961	3	"In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist takes advice from some old guys and ends up wishing he never did. He is on an empty road, flat and dry. He ends up drinking all of the water he has, and needing to stop for some more.” I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” He stopped to get more water, but once, all that came out was some tar like stuff, and then he couldn’t find another place for quite a white. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills and he came to a sigh that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit”, and passed tumble weeds and a large snake. All of these things impacted his journey with fear, caution, etc. When he finally reached a place to get a drink, he was finally satisfied. Because it was hot, and empty, he was more thirsty so therefore the setting affected the cyclist."	2	3		3																					
6962	3	"He feels alone there is noune around him to push him, and yet he keeps going trying to push him self to the end to win. The fast roads are rough and the hills are tall but he is a determined to finish."	1	1		1																					
6963	3	"Heat, abandoned roads, snakes all are reasons that affected the cyclist. The heat made him get dehydrated faster while he was using energy. The long abandoned roads further increased his doubt of living the whole bike ride. He used up allof his water. So when he got to the old pump hot dirty water came out. The snake in the story made the journey for this guy perilous and deadly. This all happened because he listened to the old guys. When the other old guy was about to tell him whereto go he said no."	1	2		2																					
6964	3	The features and the setting affect the cyclist a lot. One reason was that he was in the desert. Like in the quote “through high deserts of California. This means that it was hot and he could pass out from a heat stroke. Then he couldn’t even get any water. Like on the quote “of the rusted water pump.” it was describing how old it was then the cyclist got some out but it tasted like old battery acid. Therefore the features and setting afected The cyclist.	2	1		2																					
6965	3	"The features of the setting intensely effect the cyclist over period of time. Destined to reach yosemite national park from Lodi, California, a determined cyclist rode strongly through the gentle evening strongly. When the setting changed, so did the effect it had on the cyclist. When the man reached the first town, which was deserted, energy began depleting because the sun began to come into the picture. next, he came to a shed desperate for water only to find rusty pumps with tainted, unsafe water. When the flat terrain turned to rolling hills, the man was entirely exhausted”. With what I believed to be my last burst of enery, I manevuered down the hill”. That quote directly describes what the man was feeling and how the hills effected him. When the man stumbled across a fish camp with water, he became reloaded and replerilshed with confidence he had before when he “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile”"	3	2		3																					
6966	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example he was riding in the desert and all the towns he was going to were abandoned. The month was June a hot month and the sun was beating down on him. And he was cycling with very little water.  	1	1		1																					
6967	3	"In the essay “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit” the setting effects the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, he described it as a ghost town. This effected the cyclist because he started to have doubts about the directions he received, but he was looking foward to the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite so he persevered. The setting of the next land mark was similar to the last. There was a shed, a few rusty pipes and a corral that ""Couldn’t hold in the lamest mule.” This made the cyclist more werry of the path ahead because he was running out of water. The next place was also similar. There was an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The cyclist was running out of water and now thought he was going to die because everything was deserted. Then, finally, the setting changed. There was a store that was actually opened. The cyclist then felt happy and relieved. That is how the different settings effected the cyclist."	3	2		3																					
6968	3	"The author’s setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding. The author said that it was early summer which means it could be hot and uncomfortable weather for the cyclist. The author also that when the cyclist reached the first town, the sun began to heat down. That means the temperature is going to rise since the sun is getting stronger. Riding a bike in hot weather is very difficult because it takes a lot of effort and makes your body dehydrate faster because the heat makes you sweat which lowers your water retention. Another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclist’s location. He was traveling through the high deserts of California. This gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since he’s traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high. After the first couple town, he starts to ride on short, rolling hills. Hills take a bigger toll on a person’s body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill."	3	2		3																					
6969	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. Fem the ghost town to the bait shop, it was all a challenge for him. A misleading challenge , But a challenge . In the desert is were water grew short and he tried everything to push himself. From staring at the horizon to get to a place to another from sucking on pebble stone to not focus on water. And when he arrive at the bait shop. A sense of relief came to him, like that shop was his safe haven. But yet he would never get directions from any old-timer again. Lack was not a factor in this story. Rather it was drive and overal climate of the story. When it was two –hundred degrees left, and no water left, he pushed himself to the light. And also when he saw a building he was determined to get to it."	2	2		2																					
6970	3	"The cyclist was trying to make it to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist was in Lodi, California when he decided to ask for directions from old codgers so that he could take a short cut. He followed their directions and little did he know that he should have stuck to his original directions. The cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The cyclist became very hot and thirsty from traveling in the desert. It says in the text “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid” This shows that he had no water left to kept him dehydrated throughout his travel. Also in the text it says “with what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill” this shows that he had no energy left."	2	2		2																					
6971	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead ;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie he goes through all kinds of settings where the going could get better or worse. “I noticed the terrain changing, flat roads was replaced with short rolling @NUM1 Kurmaskie). This shows or explains that the going could get a little tougher now because he will have to be riding up hills and he is almost out of water. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” (@NUM2 Kurmaskie). This explains that the man could not get water or a ride from anywhere around, because there was nothing out there to at. This is how the setting features affected the cyclists."	2	2		2																					
6972	3	Almost all the features of the settin affect the cyclist. For instence the fact that it is hot causes him to drink a lot of water and need a lot of water. In the story it goes on about how thirsty and sweaty he is. “The water bottles contains only a few tantalizing sips. Wid rings of sweet circled my shirt.” These description suggests that he is very hot since he is sweety and hes been drinking so much. Another feature of the setting is the rolling hills that make him feel like he is never going to reach the next town. “I began breaking the ride down into distress I could make it test for.” He is making the ride seem like a lot of short rides so he could make it.	2	2		2																					
6973	3	"The setting is described by the author, were very challenging for three reasons, distance, water and the heat. All of these only occurred to multiply the effects of the others.

6974	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. The scenery makes the cyclist turn worried, unconfident, and in the end an ironic hopeful. The cyclist came upon the first “town”, and described it as only having “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corrall” I believe this is when the cyclist realized the men were a little off, and began to worry: he also couldn’t refill water supply, so fear of dehydration also kicked in already tired, the cyclist became unconfident when he came upon the sign reading, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”. Knowing that this was going to be a long and slow journey, the cycles becomes unconfident that he can make it, finally, when passing the sign saying, ""Gary and Wilber's fish camp – If you want bait for the big ones, we’ve your best bet,"" the cyclist reached a hopeful stage, because he knew he had found civilization once again. I believe your atmosphere and surroundings can effect your general mood, and that stands true today with the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6975	3	"The way the features of the setting affect the cyclist is by either making the ride easy for him or tough for him. In the essay it said ""No Town"" but without a town theres no water and water @MONTH1 lead to dehydration. It also says something about flat roads turning into ""short, rolling hills."" This means that the way he had to go was tough and making it hard for the cyclist to stay focused. Those are some examples of the setting affecting the cyclist.  "	2	2		2

And these settings caused the cyclist exsaused on his journey. First, the cyclist noticed a rode change from flat to short, rolling hills. He had to spend more energy to go up the hills which caused him to loss a certain amount of  energy. Then, his lack of water caused him a dehydrated state. He could loss an another large amount of energy by this and out of this stage, he mostly needs someone to support him or be on his side, but he was riding alone, there was no one on sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind.

6980	3	"The setting affects the cyclist because it can provide landmarks and directions. For example, the narrator states, “They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the landmarks can provide as landmarks and directions along a journey."	1	1		1

With his lack of water and diredness he runs into a big snake that he thinks is a diamond black. He easily passes the snake and moves on. Being in the intense heat and with know water he never gives up and knows he can make it to the park safely. The reason why he go's this way is because @NUM1 “old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office”. These guys gave him wrong directions. That really affected the cyclist because all of the other stuff wouldn’t have happened if he payed attention to his surroundings and people around him.	2	2		2																					
6982	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist on different occasions in different ways. For instance, when arriving at the first town, the author calls it your average ghost town but continues on with confidence. The next building he saw was an abondoned Welch’s Juice bottle factory, on the building was a singn with a boy drinking a cold glass of juice. This intimidates the reacher the begins to question the wisdom of the old men. Continuing on he reaches another building. To his relief its a bolt shop that was still in business. He goes to the sink immediately to drink the water at this point he is relieved to have water $ be near civilization instead of in dessert without a sight of liFe or building. Therefore his surrouding throughout the story make him indifferent, confident & relieved.   "	3	2		3

Some naes might be from @NUM1 miles the have to bring plenty of food and water. Also anothe affects that a cyclist has to tase is the condition of the bike.

For instance if the cyclist is in shape he/she is able to ride for a long period of time. Finally another affects is the cyclist has to know where he/she is going. For instance the man in the story didn't know where to go so thats an important keypoint."	1	1		1																					
6985	3	The setting of where cyclsit takes there journey effects the cyclist. The reason I say that is because in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclsit came upon a conflict with the setting. The conflict waas it was very hot and he did not use little things to survive witch he did. These are the reason why I say the setting of where cyclsit takes their journey matters.	1	1		1

One point, after the cyclist has been going for hours he notes, “Over on long crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage…” this setting has caused the cyclist to become so dehydrated that he can’t think. The cyclist knows the dangers of the setting around him.

For example the setting affected the cyclist mently because it all was dessert and sand with no water. He thought he was going to die, he said “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” If he had some water he would not have thought this. Also the cyclist was affected phyisicly because the road was rough it looked as it could go on forever. He was losing energy and was getting tired from riding up all the hills with little water left in him. It was hot and it seemed hopeless but if he was riding through the evergreen forest I don’t think he would have felt this way. In conclusion the cyclist was effected by the setting phyisicly and mently if he had not been riding in the desert he would not feel this way"	2	2		2																					
6989	3	"In the essay, “Rough Road ahead"" the character sees many settings through his ride, all of which affect his mood and physical condition. For example, when the author describes one place he came to as, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mute greeted me. Thes sight was troubling”, this was the turning point where the cyclist began to worry. He was running out of water, “The sun was beginning to beat down”, and he was probably tired of pedaling. But, to make matters worse, he came to rolling hills. This affected him because he had to work harder and had less water to pick him up. When he finally got to a “modernized” town his spirits were lifted, and he was able to get water to cool him down. This gave him more strength and will-power to continue his trip Yosemite park."	3	2		3																					
6990	3	"The setting of the story has a huge affect because it was such a empty terran that made him rely on only himself because of the lack of others to help. For example, if he was riding through a city for hours he could stop and take a break in a store or get water from about any where. But being in the desert it really tested his inner strenght to go on and get to safty."	1	1		1																					
6991	3	In the essay I can conclude that there were many features of the land that affected the cyclist. For example in the text it states “ridiculously large snake…blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” If you are greatly afraid of snakes that could ruin your whole trip. The cyclist was scared but over came the fear and moved on. Also another thing that changed the cyclist was the lack of water. Not having enough water could be bad. As stated “I could drop from heatstore on a gorgeous day in June…” There are many features that effected the cyclist and his journey.	1	1		1																					
6992	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie’s, “Rough Road Ahead Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” there are several features that effect the cyclist. “..and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie) Deserts in June are extremely hot and dry and caused the cylist to become dehydrated quickly. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The change from flat lands to hills made the ride more strenuous on the cyclist. These conditions directly affect the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6993	3	"The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist was riding through the deserts in June. The cyclist barely had water at the end of the stony. A lot of buidings were abandoned, right when he needed water. That is how the setting affected him."	1	1		1																					
6994	3	In the essay rough road ahead the setting does effect the cyclist because he has been pedaling for so long and he is becoming dehydrated “I had been hitting my watter bottles pretty regularly. I was in the @LOCATION1”. Another reason the setting effects him is because he is starting to see mirages “A sandblasted picture of a boy pouring a refreshing glass of grape juice into his mouth could still be seen.	1	1		1																					
6995	3	"The features like not enough water not enough sense of direction, effect the cyclist because he needs water to keep on peadiling. He needs maps to know what direction and where he is going. From not enough water he said “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a lost entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and there been sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that pargraph” That site ment that the old man’s sense of directin was out of date. They did not no where any thing was at just there in giant poarch."	1	1		1																					
6996	3	The features of the setting is that it is hot and dry. The way that it affects the cyclist is that he gets very hot and he drinks almost all of his water and he only has about @NUM1 sips left when he gets to the other town. It also effects him because he had an advantage. The advantage that he had was he left before the sun came up. So then he had a time to get cool. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is when he gets even some of the hills he gets a little bit of the wind. Also when the cyclist was thirsty he put pebbles into his mouth.	2	2		2																					
6997	3	"Setting plays a crucial part in the cyclist’s mood and energy. For example, in a cool @DATE1 day riding gently downhill, the rider is happy and energetic. However, “traveling through the high deserts of California in June is not the best environment for laughs and ease. The cyclist in the story was hot exhausted, and hydrated. He thought, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Where the cyclist rides can have a huge effect on the cyclist himself."	2	2		2																					
6998	3	The cyclist was riding his bike and was trying to get to rosemite and he had lack of water but he went on any way and he had to go past a snake and got scared.	1	1		1																					
6999	3	"All the features of the settings affect his rythm, determination and will to win because it sets him off his goal a little bit when he should just try to ignore stuff the best as he can. Instead of thinking about it. If I was him I would just ride my bike & think about I thing winning!"	1	1		1																					
7000	3	"To a cyclist, the surrounding setting can either cause triumph or despair. The cyclist was given very old directions. He was given back roads that are abandoned now. These towns had no people in them normally that would not matter, but he “was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” (@NUM1). If there was shade, a breeze, and @NUM2 weather, he would be fine, but he is pedaling a bike in a desert during the summer. A “ghost town” with no good water could have killed him. A cyclist needs to know their surroundings and be prepared for what nature throws at them."	2	2		2																					
7001	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. First of all I think that when the cyclist came across the “ghost town” he felt alone and discouraged. I think he felt like he was never going to find his way and there was no one there to help him. Also the long hilly highway with nothing but desert on either side basically gave him the discouraging feeling that that road was never going to end and there was no way out of what he had started. I think it made him feel trapped and it was so dry that there was no water in sight and it made him feel so much thirstier than he was. Overall I think that it had really physical and psycoligical effects on him. 	2	2		2																					
7002	3	"In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist runs into a couple obstacles and they affected him in many ways. In the story the cyclist is riding a bike for miles. “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.... in my dehydrated state.” This quote only lists a few of his problems. He had tumbleweed, a snake and he was dehydrated. He had to stick pebbles in his mouth because he heard that they take away your dehydration. All through out the story he ran into many problems or obstacles but overcame them very well."	2	2		2																					
7003	3	"The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. Some of these features include:- the heat, dangerous animals, not a lot of civilization, and the terrain. In the essay, each of these features were spoke of and they all affected the cyclist in a negative way. For example, when the cyclist headed from the intense heat, he needed to find a town. The first “town” he found he described as a “ghost town” It took a while to find another town and he had been hitting [his] water bottles pretty regularly and [he] was travelling through the high deserts of California in June so he was getting really dehydrated and ready to collapse. The flat road [being] replaced by short, rolling hills wasn’t helping either. The terrain really affected the ?? he had to exert in order to keep going, along with being dehydrated the cyclist had to deal with dangerous animals. During his journey “a ridiculously large snake blacked the majority of the ?? “which  ?? him it could have ?? The features of the getting definitely affected the cyclist in many ways"	3	2		3																					
7004	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, the heat made the cyclist overheated. For instance, the weather was sunny in June. Also, the hills made the cyclist very tired. For example, the cyclist was losing energy and had to keep pushing. Lastly, the setting had no places that could have helped the cyclist. For instance, the cyclist had trouble finding a place with water to drink. In conclusion, the setting affected the biker in a very negative way."	2	1		2																					
7005	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in the way that it is so hot that he is quickly be coming dehydrated. Another feature is that all the building seem to be either abandoned or in despair.	1	1		1																					
7006	3	The features of the setting strongly affect the cyclist. Now the setting is in the california desert on a hot day in sane wich caueses the cyclist to drink all of his water wich later malice him dehydrated. The barren desert with no landmarks causes the cyclist to become lost wich is the main problem with the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
7007	3	"The setting of this story plays a huge part in the final outcome. The author makes a mention that he is travelling through the high deserts of California in June. This sentence alone tells the reader that it is hot. And not hot by @LOCATION2 standards, where it gets to @NUM1 degrees, maybe, by noon. That means that the day starts at @NUM2. By noon, it's past @NUM3. Also, the author comes to a sign marked ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” @CAPS1 he makes note that he’s only going 12 mph. Before he reaches any sort of civilization, he has already drunken most of his water, his last ""tentalizing sips,"" This is his main problem, his lack of water. He drank most of it in the beginning of his ride, thinking he’d be okay, but he regretted it later on"	2	2		2																					
7008	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was in the middle of almost nowhere dehydrating. There were no signs for resting areas where you can find water fountans around. The cyclist put pebbles in there mouth to try  forget about being thirsty. Her surroundings were bumpy so she swallowed one. She just kept going and her words were “I was going to die.” First the cyclist was in danger of dehydrating, and end her satisfaction. The cyclist made it alive as she saw Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp. Her setting was very clear until then. The cyclist was then relieved and made it alive."	1	1		1																					
7009	3	"Because he is dehydrated, the setting makes him worse. He’s biking, in California, in @LOCATION2. It’s not and the sun is probably scorching. The heat plus all the biking he’s doing, is making him even more thirsty and tired."	1	1		1																					
7010	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. The cyclist had been riding on the ‘high deserts of California in June.” The cyclist also saw a “ridiculously large snake.” There was also no signs of civilization for miles.” There was no one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The cyclist went through many different obsticales travilng, triying to get to Yosemite. I think the settingS affected the cyclist in many ways."	1	1		1																					
7011	3	"Features of the setting affect cyclists greatly. Things like weather, terrain, temperature, altitude can make or break a cyclist. In this essay, the heat and hills on the road challenge the cyclist. He just keeps going through, and eventually he gets to civilization. This lets you know that you can’t mother nature control you."	1	1		1																					
7012	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The author is getting worn out and is rapidly running out of water. He “was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. This shows how the setting is causing him to become greatly exhausted.	1	1		1																					
7013	3	"The feature of the setting affected the cyclist tremendously. According to the text, the cyclist was confident he would make the eighteen miles until he passed through the flat round, that was replaced by short rolling hills. He said and I quoted “I toiledon” he sounds like it’s hopeless, that he wasn’t going to make it. As you can see the setting does effect the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
7014	3	"The setting of “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was very hot deserts. On a bike ride there are not many places to stop for food or water. On a bike ride you cant bring a lot of louage with you. Only important materials and a big enough jug of water. An example from the text to show how bad it was out there. “I got down on my hands, and knees, working,the handle of the rusted pump with all my strength. He was so thirst and tired he didn’t know how else to get some water"	1	1		1																					
7015	3	"In the setting the young man is faced  by some challenges that make him as an individual a stronger person. For example he was proud of himself he mad himself happy by saying at the end ""yes sir! I own a very good map"". He knows that he got through the heat, dry air, snakes, and a low supplie of water to get to where he was determined to be Yosemite."	1	2		2																					
7016	3	"The setting in the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit"" affects the cyclist because it’s a dry area in California in June. The cyclist really needs water which is the main thing affecting him besides the fact that he’s lost in a ghost town. Therefore, the lack of water and misleading directions are the main features displayed."	1	1		1																					
7017	3	"The feature of the cyclist was very good “it erodding to who he say in paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1”. I would describe it as a fun. It also looks this time was one of his bes time. Here are some examples he is happy, competive, and thin is full. I’m going to explain my examples. First, he looks hoppy becaus in the story he said “the morning with strong legs and smile on my face. the phase can to you how hoppy he felt. My second example was competive, he seems like a competive person, bcouse he is very heathy and lead to to take a ride from the bike.

7018	3	"In the story “Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. We can tell because the author writes “that road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This tells us that cyclist is hard to ride on the road. The speed limit is also affect the cyclist. When the the speed limit sign is appear, the character feels “life can feel so cruel” (kurmaskie @NUM1). It tells us that character can not do what he is trying to do. The bad road and speed limit sigh effect the cyclist."	1	2		2																					
7019	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the begginning the setting was at the old man’s place and the cyclist was happy and confident. When he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated. When he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad. When he finally reached the store he was excited and relived. That is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip	1	2		2																					
7020	3	"In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, in the beginning of the story it says that, “The sun was beginning to beat down”, the temperature was beginning to rise, but it had not really affected the cyclist because he had plenty of water supply. Next the story says, “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”, California’s temperature is really high and June is one of the hottest months of the year. The temperature was very high and the cyclist did not have much water left. This was affecting the cyclist because he was tired, hot, and getting dehydrated. Finally, at the end of the story the terrains were changing and there had been more hills and a road that was not as smooth as pavement because it was a dirt road and the hills were making the cyclist have to cycle harder to go past making him very tired. Also the temperature was still very high and he did not have barely any water left. By the end of the ride the setting of roads, temperature and the distance of the ride had made the cyclist exguasted and dehydrated. "	2	3		3																					
7021	3	"In the short story “Rough road ahead .Do not exceed posted speed limit ,” The cyclist faced many difficulties .These difficulties were the result of the setting .The story takes place in “the high deserts of California in June “ .Because the month June is very warm , and the climate of California is usually hot and dry ,the cyclist ran into problems .Not only did this affect the cyclist , but he travelling through the desert .The setting also included several abandoned towns along the way , which contributed to the problem .The cyclistsoon ran out of water , and discovered the towns that lay before him were unoccupied .He had no choice but to continue with his the journey ."	2	3		3																					
7022	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist is many different ways. One way is the hilly terrain makes him work harder and wears him out. Since the cyclist is getting worn out he needs to drink more and more water. Now that he’s drinking more water his running out of it faster and wanting more and more of it. Then when he starts to use less water to conserve it until he gets to the next town he starts to become dehydrated and more tired and he starts to feel weak. Also because the terrain is hilly his legs are working harder to go up the hills and his legs become tired. It also starts to get hotter and he gets thirsty more often. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
7023	3	In the poem “Do not exceed speed limit” the setting is described as very rough and dry. The man on the bike says he was running low on water. At one point he says “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridi culously large shake” This makes the setting sound dry and empty with a harmful snake around. this  man also said about a sign which read “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” this also made it hard for the man to ride. These are the settings that affected the biker in the story.	1	1		1																					
7024	3	The feature of it is the landscape the characters the plot the end and the begining.     	0	0		0																					
7025	3	"The setting in “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted speed limits” affects the mood of the cyclist in that every time the setting changes the mood of the cyclist changes. In the begining of the story the cyclist is riding through the “cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” @CAPS2 this time the cyclist is enjoying his trip and is in a positive mood. As the story goes on “there was no one in sight, not a building, a car, or structure of any land.” At this point in the story the cyclist has exchanged his positive mood for a desperate one as his water begins to run out."	2	2		2																					
7026	3	"The setting in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” makes the bikers travel a very difficult challenge that he has to overcome. When the “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” the biker must use more energy to peddl up the hills. This made it hard on him to overcome his exauhtion of physical endurance. Also, he states that he was “traveling through the high desert of California in June” this weather is very hot and dry, therefor causing him to quickly run low on water. And, because he was in the desert, there was no sign of towns or people or salvation of any type. These conditions made it hard on the biker because he knew if he dropped from dehydration, no one would be around to save him. In conclution, these hard conditions challenged the bike a great deal."	2	3		3																					
7027	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was on a very long bike ride to Yosemite National Park. However, on the way there, he had to cross through a desert like terrain. The blistering sun had been beating on his back for many miles. All the heat built up a desire for him to get water. He had been very tired. The terrain had made him drenched in sweat. If it wasn’t so hot, then he wouldn’t of had that much of a hard time. The desert contains a very high temperature, which makes it harder to endure physical activities. Even if you are to have a high endurance. The heat will make you very tired, and you will lose a lot of energy. Also, it didn’t help anything, that the elderly men, had gave him terrible directions. That is why I think the setting affected the cyclist."	2	3		3																					
7028	3	"The setting in the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” affect the author in a big way. The features of the setting are that “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The fact that there was nothing around him, made the author lose hope and trust. After the author saw the old juice factory, he felt like something was happening in his favor. Then he saw that it was abandoned and he lost all hope. He shows his loss of hope again when he talks about how he’s going to die. He shows that he’s lost trust in the old men when he talks about never accepting advice from “old-timers who haven’t left their porches since Carter was in office.” In conclusion, the features of the directions he was given and lose any hope of surviving."	3	2		3																					
7029	3	"At the beginning of the ride, the cyclist is feeling good and strong and the day as well as the journey, is just beginning. The sun begins to beat down on the cyclist but he remains upbeat, still feeling good and barely noticing the heat. When he arrives at an old rusty water pump, he feels disappointed and tastes a liquid that resembles “battery acid.” The terrain begins to feel like more of a hill, which makes the struggle even worse. The cyclist is drinking water more now, and is becoming tired. He comesto a rough road and says, “sometimes life can feel so cruel,” which lets the reader know he is feeling the negative affects of what he presumed to be a nice bike ride, a snake blocks his path and he becomes dehydrated. The cyclist feels refreshment and relief at a sign for a fish camp, and his thirst is replenished when he takes a satisfying gulp of water in the restroom. The water is a feature @NUM1 the setting that refreshes the cyclist, while the hot sun, rough terrain, and unknown area are features that make the cyclist feel lost and tired."	2	2		2																					
7030	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the sand and the intense heat are two big parts of the setting, which make him thirsty. “... followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees”. This is a quote that explains the intense heat that the cyclist is feeling. The sun is another big feature that affects him. This is how the setting affects the cylist."	1	1		1																					
7031	3	"The feature effect the cyclist because he wants to go somewhere spectaculiar and amazing like. Like for example, he said he was thriving on this one spot forever and he finally got their and it was a ghost town and he chuckeled and roud away because it wasn’t what he was looking for. I belive that this guy in judging every place he goes by the way it looks and not by what it haves to offer like he doesn't believe in getting direction from an old mat, but yet he still took it. I believe that he wants to get were he wants to go and not let anybody get in his way no matter what it's like he is looking for a perfect spot and he think want he finds it he will be filled with story."	1	1		1																					
7032	3	"The setting can affect a cyclist in many ways, if it were hot out, he would be thirsty and sweaty. If there were hills the cyclist would be tired as well as thirsty. The cyclist although thirsty and tired is determined to get through and find a town. The cyclist said” I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine,” By saying this, he knows that he can make it that far as well as determined to do so. With the terrain causing even more trouble for him, would make it more difficult, but he knows that he must overcome his challenging activity but he still keeps a strong spirit with that, he can do just about anything because he has the encouragement he needs."	2	2		2																					
7033	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his mood change. In the @LOCATION1, where it’s nice, shaded, and cool, he feels fairly good. He’s excited and ready to take on the adventure of a new path. His still in a good mood when he comes to the first town. As he moves on, and his water supply deplets, his mood sinks lower and he becomes more frustrated. In the ironic twist of fate that he finds a Welch’s Grape Juice, Factory, he is about to quit. He is dejected and almost ready to admit defeat. But he forces himself to go on, and when he finally reaches a place with water, his relief is mixed with wariness of the old man sitting on the porch. He will never take after for granted or advice from old men ever again."	2	3		3																					
7034	3	"The features of the setting only drain the cyclist's willpower. The things he sees discourage him, for example one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the larnest, mule greeted me. This sight was troubling .” The desolation begins to wear away his hope of finding a building or town sometimes the things are psychologically damaging,” In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it – had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.” For someone who is quickly running out of water, this this irony could make one lose their resolve to continue. The snake and rolling hills slow him down, and make him use more energy. The heat dehydrates the cyclist even faster. The environment is a hostile one for a cyclist.    "	3	2		3																					
7035	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First the climate affected him the most thats so because he became to hot, drank a lot, and then became dehydrated. So he had no energy because of dehydration. Another one is the built of the road. That’s so because it was rocky bumpy, winding, hills with being dehydrated the road was very tempting to just give up and die. Then the heat got him because there was no shade, no water left, and the sun just beating down on him."	2	2		2																					
7036	3	"During the cyclist trail there are many factors that play out to be disadvantages to him/her. There are rough roads, bad water pump, abandoned battling plant, and the long lasting truth that it wasn’t even his path. All of these factors create something new in the cyclist.

Then , what is originally a sign of hope because another let down. A water pump found just in time, but the water is no longer any determination they reach “rough roads” creating, once again, a more painful journey. Finally, the cyclist sees a building in the distance, but again, deserted. The only goodness as the poor cyclist is when they came along a bait “tar, some sign of civilization that keeps him alive. Hope after hope arises to the end in turmoil upon turmoil. These encounters would cause oneself to become persimistic on even a task, but he sought through. These encounters create an interesting meal. Every time you catch word on hope you become entitled to what could happen next and then feel sorry for the cyclist after having hope on multiple occasions. The steady and salidrising the plot keeps the reader entitled wanting more."	3	3		3

As the cyclist rides to his destination, he encounters obstacles and views his surroundings. The author gives the starting setting in the second paragraph as “a reservoir campground outside of lodi, California an early. Summer evening.” The reader is informed that the temperatures are not in summers in California. This gives the cyclist his main conflict, the lack of water. With temperatures being high, it is easier to become quickly dehydrated. The author stated, “The sun was beginning to beat down and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Also, to cyclist encounters a ridiculously large” snake in the middle of the rode. The reader is aware that there are many conflicts which one can encounter while cycling. There are finally many features of the setting that let the cyclist know where he currently is, and the place where he wants to be most, the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” @CAPS1 the essay, the cyclist is determined to reach Yosemite, and although he faces troubles, he doesn’t give up and is relieved when he finally receives water."	3	3		3

When the road began the change, the speaker’s determination did too, “Flat road were replaced by short hills”. The terrain began to change and the speaker became doubtful of the old man that that directed him towards the shortcut. “I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listned to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades”. The heat in desert made the speaker thirsty causing him to drink all his water. There was no source of water therefore he decided to suckenc-stone. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst”,. But the bumpy terrain didn’t allow him to do that. He hit a bump and swallowed the stone. The speaker began to panice, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean”.

California is a relatively hot state and June is one of it’s warmer months. The terrain didn’t favor in the riders either “Flat road had turned into, short rolling hills “(pg @NUM2).

7046	3	The features of the setting in this story gives the cyclist determination. Since the desert	1	1		1																					
7047	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if is very hot and is summertime. The cyclist wouldn’t have gotten so tired and exhausted if he wasn’t in a “ghost town”, with the, “sun beggining to beat down”. It was in @CAPS1 for nia during June so it was. Very hot, the water was also @NUM1 degrees! The text as states there were rolling hills and tumble weeds, so it must have been a desert kind of area. The trip was also a very long one, “about forty miles into the petal”, causing him to be tired. As you can see the setting was an area with no people, and it was very hot."	2	2		2																					
7048	3	The features of the setting is very important for cyclist. If the setting is wrong they could be in many danger. It is really important to have a clear setting.	1	1		1																					
7049	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist horribly! For example, he ran into the worse problems and couldnt really do anything about them. also, he started out fine, then he started to become dehydrated. He didnt have much water left and he was only @NUM1 miles up the road. a loss of water was very affective in June traveling through a desert. also, the damage of the road was very affective too because hes on a bike and not too good of balance. These features could affect the cyclist in many ways because of the weather, temperature, loss of water, road damages and snakes. the cyclist was on a bike and couldnt really protect himself, and he was dehydrated, and tired. "	2	1		2																					
7050	3	"Throughout his journey, the protagonist in the story encounters obstacles in the setting. First off, he is cycling in the hot, dry, desert. There is no civilization or natural water source, so he faces dehydration. Additionally, the terrain he was riding on proved difficult. He encountered rolling hills that took a lot of energy to ride up. There were even signs for “rough road ahead,” @CAPS1 obstacle was a mental obstacle. He came across an abandoned juice factory when he needed an occupied building. These were ironic and mentally frustating. The cyclist must have lost hope in @CAPS2 civilization after he found @NUM1 abandoned examples of civilization. This discouragement must have made his journey more mentally challenging."	3	3		3																					
7051	3	The features in the setting would affect the cyclist because they would want to have towns with water so they can restock they’re water. They would want water even more after going up hills. They would also want a palce to gey something to eat and maybe rest.	1	1		1																					
7052	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because of the heat and had know water. Also how rough the road ahead was. Another problem was the dry air and snakes laying out everywhere in the desert. Also the hills were a big problem to because of the heat and know water. Finally the other problem was he knew he was going to die and the birds would eat at him and their would be nothing left of him. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
7053	3	"The hot, dry, desert setting affects the cyclist in many different ways, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (@NUM1). The cyclist is very hot. He was thirsty but, “A tarlike substance ooted out, followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of zoo (@NUM2). The water was barely even water, so he didn’t have much to drink until the next town. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills” (@NUM3). Flat road is much easier to bike on then hills. He was thirstier and more tired after biking on hills “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could still be seen” (@NUM4) on an old welchs grape fruit factory. This makes the cyclist envicus of the young boy. It also discourages him. In conclusion, the water being bad, the terrain change. the picture of the young boy, and the fact that the cyclist drinks a lot makes him tired, hot, envious, and generally exausted."	3	2		3																					
7054	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has water and plenty of it, the setting seems to be smooth, easy riding. This means that he doesn’t have to use much water, but he still uses some because anyone that rides @NUM1 miles on a bike will need plenty of water no matter what the terrain is like. The features of the setting affect the cyclist toward the middle and end of his trip greatly because it gets rough and hilly and so he needs more water that he doesn’t have. And since he was planning on being able to get water at the first stop he didn’t conserve it as well, so this left less water for him to have when he really needed it. He then became dehydrated after his first stop, and he didn’t get any more water there so it caused him to dehydrate. So it seem that the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has plenty of water and doesn’t really need it the terrain is smooth and easy to ride but as he drinks his water the terrain gets rougher and worse. So the features of the setting affects him greatly in that they don’t help him they just get worse when he needs it to get better."	3	2		3																					
7055	3	"There are many ways that the features affect the cyclist. One is that he is already scared to go up this really big hill. Another is that he is going up this big hill its hot, there snakes, hes scared and tired. Almost all of his energy is gone. He just wants to stop he is determined to go up this hill. He also knows that it cant be that bad because he can just relax al the way back down."	1	1		1																					
7056	3	"After reading, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” I noticed that the setting of this adventure affected the narrator. First of all, the heat cause the narrator to be uncomfortable and thirstier. While on the moving, he refers to the trip as a ,”water-deplating” one this quote shows that he was lacking water and that this was a major problem. Also it refers to the road as “rolling hills"", and this shows the reader that they seem to go on forever. This lowers the narrator’s hope of getting there quickly. Also the desert gives the author low hope of reaching his destination. The setting affects the narrator both physically and mentally."	2	3		3																					
7057	3	"The setting of the story affected the cyclist because it kept him going because he was all alone and had no help. First, just the fact that he was by himself kept his determination high. If he would have had a partner they could have stopped and took a break or shared the water. Next, the fact that there were no buildings, houses or anything in sight affected him.  He got a bolt of strength just from seeing a building ahead. If there had been building he could have stopped and asked for more water and rested. The fact that he was in a desert in California in the middle of June really affected him. He had no determination there because there was nothing he could do to better the situation in his cause. He even at one point felt that he might die. In conclusion the setting really affected the cyclist because it determined his endurance and will power."	2	2		2																					
7058	3	"Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways.for example, he ask the older guts, ""that haven't left rheir porches since carter was in the office where the next placewas to get water. Also he was out in the middle of nowhere. It was also in June were the weather was warm,and he didn't have a lot of water."	1	1		1																					
7059	3	"Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, he was in “high desert of California in June.” This affected him many ways. It makes him become very dehydrated. He had to conserve his water and chew on pebbles to get any spit to collect in his mouth. Also, the road became very rough. The new terrain made him has to push himself harder and lose energy quicker. The last feature would be the distance. He had to travel a lot further then he had planned to. This again affected his energy and spirits with thoughts of possible death, and not be able to make it. Those are how just some of the features of the setting affected the cyclist."	2	3		3																					
7060	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Since the cyclist was in the middle of no where, he couldn’t get any water. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst,” he was so thirsty that he barely had any energy to keep going, “The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke,” it was hot out and he had no water so this affected his energy."	1	1		1																					
7061	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist. The harsh turane proved a challenge when his water supply was low and all towns had been abandoned leaving him no refill. The heat was also a factor quickly creating him weary and tired. On the bike ride he had a glimmer of hope at an old water pump but quickly disappointed when the hot liquid tasted of battery acid. The setting set the conflict and helped achive the tone the author was looking for to affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
7062	3	"The settings effect the cyclist by the roughness of the ride. First, they go over a bunch of rocks, and the tire could poys. Next it could be smooth and easy. Also, it could be far away from towns and difficult to get back. There could be a lack of water making you dehydrate. That is how the setting around the cyclist could effect him."	1	1		1																					
7063	3	"The setting desented in the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summer’s day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as he passed abandoned towns and factories. The dangerousness for a biker in this area is very high. The biker was lucky to have made it out of those sorroundings alive."	2	2		2																					
7064	3	The desert area of California was makeing him dehydrated. The trip was long but he had enough water to get him there only if he took the maps way. The old men thot “haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office” told him a shortcut that he followed and ended up almost killing him due to heat stroke and dehydration. If the cyclist would have followed the map he could have stoped off at a store for more water if the setting was that bad.	1	1		1																					
7065	3	"The features of the setting  affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting was a dry California desert, for if it had been a busting city, the events in the story would have not happened. The author asked a group of old men for directions to Yosemite National Park, and , “like a foolish yuuth,” folluwed their advice. Everything started out fine until he reached the second town. He –ans almost dehydrated and “in an ironic twist” he reached on abandoned grape juice foctary. Almost all hope was lost for him until he rounded the bend and came across his new hope: “Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp-if you wont bait pur the big ones, we’re your best bet “ in He end he learned tostick to a map instead of old people who “haven’t left the confines of their purchess,hce carter was ,h office”"	3	3		3																					
7066	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because first he realized that getting advise from people that no longer drive or even leave of the porch would be unuseful. When the author say “old timers who haven’t lest the confined of them porches since carter was in office” that what he is explaining. He then say “I rode  into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face” he was refering back to how hes  on the rode  alone riding the bike and theres not a car insight any where around. The curbs of the turns where so sharp that only a bicycle could make them as safe as he did “He whipped the sweat from his eyes to make sure it wasn’t mirage and tried not get to excited” @CAPS1 in this situation would have made many people excited about the long lonely cicle by his self.	2	2		2																					
7067	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making his way to the Yosemite National Park a longer and more difficult and dangerous way to go. He takes the awee of going that way by some old folks that he says “haven’t gotten off there porches since carter was in office.” I think tha tthere would be a reason to not listen to them though they @MONTH1 have wisdom.	1	1		1																					
7068	3	"In the setting there are no cars and no buildings meaning no help. The cyclist is tired and dehydrated because he ran out of water. No one was around because it was the desert. The cyclist was dehydrated but kept going to his destination. The road was straight but almost to the end there were many hills. Along with having to bike up the hills he almost ran into a snake. The weather was hot he had no water, he could have died."	2	1		2																					
7069	3	"The features in the setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” greatly affect the biker. For example, the heat is constantly drying the biker out. Also, at the first town the old water pump proved to be a hopeless cause with water tastd like “battery acid”. Even after that were more problems. There was a sign that posted a max speed limit. The biker was doing about one-fifth of that speed. This affects his mood and he realizes that it will be along ride. The pebbles that he found helps him out. He remembers reading that sticking pebbles in your mouth calms your thirst. Finally, the bait store gave him the relief that he needed at the end of his trip. In conclusion, the setting makes the riders journey an  one, but in the end the bait store had just what he needed."	2	2		2																					
7070	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example their was not towns close near. One reason this affected the cyclist is because if the towns were near each other if he ran out of water there would be stores close by. In addition he could have a heatstroke and there would be no one around to get help from and he could easily die. In my point of view of the reading I believe where he was located is what affected him mostly.	1	1		1																					
7071	3	"The hot wheather is dehydrating the cyclist, who can’t find more water. The hills are rough terrain is draining the energy he has. The heat is so rough he has to break the road down it to polants he wants to get to. He get drained physically and emotionally. He has a hard journey."	1	1		1																					
7072	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist on how the nature of life he was hydrated or not. On the posts “Do not exceed posted speed limit “is after “wide rings of dried sweat clinched my thirst, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June”. This shows that he is dehydrated from the sun which is a feature of the setting. “a tarlike distance surged out, followed by cockish water feeling somelane in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” Cyclist know that there is no water in this place which is another feature of the setting which affects the cyclist.  "	2	1		2																					
7073	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist from the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, “by Joe Kurmaskie had many obsticales to over come. When he first showed the old men his map he was probably thinking to himself, “@CAPS1 my gosh, what did I get myself into?!” Because the cyclist trusted the shortcut the old men told him about he had a lot of doubt, anger and determination later on during the day. It was really hot and he was running out of water making him worried he was going to get dehydrated and die because he was starting to think he was getting lost. The hills also affected the cyclist by making him tired. In conclusion, the cyclist, in the end, found a little store by all the determination and effort he put in."	2	2		2																					
7074	3	"The setting where the cyclist is at is in a desert, and it can affect him because, he could get a heatstroke. The text states that he is lacking water and if you get too dehygrated it's not healthy and you die from it. However, when the wind is against his face, it can cool him down,along with the sweat. As long as he has some lijid left, it should be ohang. "	1	1		1																					
7075	3	"The setting of this story is a dry, hot desert in the middle of June. These features of the setting, effect the author, because it shows how he starts of strong + determained and his left weak + doubtful. In the begining of the story, the author says, “Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” This is showing the readers confidence he has with himself before starting his trip. Later on in the story, he discribes the setting as “the high deserts of California in June.” He is discribing the heat + what he is facing. It goes on to tell how he is dehydrated in worn out. But he comes to a town, ""cool water drippen from my head as I slumped against the wall."" @CAPS1 he is relieved. As the setting changes, the authors attitude changes as well."	3	3		3																					
7076	3	"Different features of the setting affect a cyclist for example,temperatare really changes everything. If it’s too hot, you’re going to get tired really easily. Then again, if its too cold, breathing gets really hard. The biker in the story was in desert area in june, so it was really hot & tiring. Also, the terrain as affects a clyclist. If the road is filled with hills getting up those hills is difficult. If it’s all down hill, it’s really easy, but all uphill is hard, level terrain is fairly easy. The cyclist in the story was in level terain, then it turned into a lot of hills which tired him out. Features of the setting really affect a cyclist"	2	1		2																					
7077	3	"The setting affects the cyclist because he is faced with roadways he is unsure of the weather is hot and dry and there are wild animals. The text states,"	2	2		2																					
7078	3	"The setting has a great impact on the condition of the cyclist. First, it is a very hot dry in June. The cyclist is maneuvering his way through “high deserts in @LOCATION1” where he comes across many hills that he must climb over and maneuver his way down. With all of these obstacles and the heat slowing him down he will need water but is already low."	1	1		1																					
7079	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" the narrator is faced with the challenging and perilous desert he must cross. He wasnt traveling in a car, he was riding a bike and crossing a desert on foot is tiring enough let alone on a bike. ""The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can be so cruel.” In the horrible @NUM3 degree heat the narrator gulps down his water bottles at such a rate that he’s at risk of running out. Not only that but he’s been pedaling for such a long time that he @MONTH1 pass out from exaustion or,.” I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadnt been off their porch in decades.” So I would say the narrator was pretty hasseled by his surroundings. "	3	2		3																					
7080	3	"The setting affected the character in ways that would usually affect people. When he got into the first town he had ran out of water to drink but the towns water he was in now tasted like battery acid so that’s not safe to drink. As he started to head out the scenery changed. “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is hinting at the fact that maybe this town he is going to @MONTH1 be abandoned or not used. He saw a huge rattle snake and tumbleweed. Which are usual signs of a desert. It was hard for him to keep his balance as he says, “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” He ended up getting to the point where he had to put rocks in his mouth to trick his mind that he wasnt thirsty anymore."	2	2		2																					
7081	3	"The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because at first he had to watch out for the snakes that usually crossed the roads, then the streets were crooked and bumpy, so the road structure throw him off a bit, and he was riding his bike in June and it was very hot, and he had lack of water so he thought he was going to have a heatstroke. These things affected how the cyclist performed on his bike."	2	1		2																					
7082	3	"The cyclist is riding through the high deserts in California. In this environment everything looks the same for miles. The cyclist is dehydrated and is getting worse because he has no protection from the sun. It is hard for the cyclist to keep in good spirits because he is not even coming across any towns or sources of water. The cyclist says “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’ This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This made the cyclist doubt the old timers directions. In the wide open desert, the cyclist was only coming across something after at least twenty miles. The heat, lack of water, and lack of civilization made the cyclist think he was “going to die and the birds would pick [him] clean. When the cyclist spots the abandoned Welch’s factory, the cyclist says they used what seemed to be their last bit of energy. The conditions affected the cyclist"	3	2		3																					
7083	3	"The setting affects the cyclist by showing that he is a little angry. He states that “don’t remember the saying don’t take candy from strangers.” So we know he is upset about something. He is mad about the fact that this one older man tells him directions on how to get somewhere, and it’s wrong. The man figure that out halfway through the story. He also said that “the old man hasn’t been off his porch since Carter was in office,” so he needs to get his directions up to date. So the beginning is a negative attitude."	1	1		1																					
7084	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the settings affected the character because he thought he wouldn’t make it to the park because of the way things looked around him. Because of the rolling hills and snakes he didn’t think he would make it any where and thought he was going to die. That’s how the setting affected the character.	1	1		1																					
7085	3	"While the cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park he listen to some old  men who gave him directions for a shortcut.When he began his trip everything was fine.But then he found that along the “shortcut” there was no building.By the time he figured out that the old men were mistake he had almost run out of water.There was nothing around that he could drink.He was getting very thirsty.The fact that he was in the deserts of California in June didn’t make his task any easier.About halfway through his ride he ran into rolling hills, which made his trip even harder.Towards the end he found a building and he used all of his strength to get to it just to find that it was an abandoned juice factory.This made going without water much harder as well as he gazed at the picture of the boy who was drinking juice.In the end he finally make it to a pait shop where he guzzled all the water he possibly could"	3	3		3																					
7086	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. For example when he was riding on the road he would pick a destination and ride to it. Then he would take a break. If this destination was a building he would be strong willed and determined. If it looked like their was nothing ahead but hills, he would just ride and wait to fall over dead without a care in the world."	1	1		1																					
7087	3	"One ramsackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubled. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. With any luck, I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. Rough road ahead if he didn’t take the old mans advice, he would have enjoyed his bike ride he needed a new map."	3	2		3																					
7088	3	"The features in the story affect the cyclist by not having anything to drink. The person was going to a place far away with out any food or water for miles. He could have died. There is anther feature the effects the cyclist, and that is no one is around for miles. If he died out there, no one would no know for days. I know this because in the story he said “ There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. ''That says it all, the last feature is that it was hot. I know this because it says ''I was travelling through high deserts of California in June.'' It is hot is June, and it is even hotter in California."	2	2		2																					
7089	3	"People who travel will almost always encounter difficulties. For the main character in this story, thus a very true. His first mistake was when he took directions from the “old-timers” by doing that, he travelled extremely far out of his way. In the story he talked to the old men on the porch. He said, “what I shouldn’t have done was to let them see my map"".  Another problem he faced was when he began to run out of water.  This caused a problem to him because of dehydration. In the story he said, “The water bottle contained any a few tantalizing sips.” @CAPS1, another problem he encountered was the desert area that he was riding through. This caused problem for him because there wasn’t anybody around to help him if he needed it. In the story he says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, cars, or structure of any kind.” By reading this story, we’ve realized that people encounter problems everywhere, however any problem, no matter what size, can be overcomed"	1	1		1																					
7090	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because on page @NUM1 it talk about how the cyclist had to go down a hill then find a factory for juice. Like if the cyclist don’t find any building he would of kept the hill and wasted the little bit of energy for actaire.	1	1		1																					
7091	3	"Since the cyclist was really thirsty, the setting was not very appealing considering it was a desert. You could tell she was stressing because she was sweating and having a trouble time trying to pedal."	1	1		1																					
7092	3	The setting effects the cyclist in away that most people can’t tell cycling forty miles on maybe a gallon of water is hard expecialy in California “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June” The effect on his body would be rather devastating.	1	1		1																					
7093	3	In the story the Features of the setting affects the cyclist is that when he is riding he has very little water. Also he takes advise from old men and he meets up with an @CAPS1 Snake and he goes down an dirt Road he has no water at the time there. The conclusion is that he comes of the dirt Road and @CAPS2 the main Road that he travels. Also he promised to stick to it in the @CAPS3. That is how you should stick things at in the future.	1	1		1																					
7094	3	"The biker has many features in his story. For example he has discriptive words that put pictures into my head. For example “One long, crippling hill” I can picture it in my head. “There was no one in sight.” All of these parts of the story put pictures in my head. Thats a good thing, for example you want the reader to understand it, and by having discribing words help."	1	1		1																					
7095	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One way is that the “rolling hills” @MONTH1 let the rider get more tired. Another way is that of water from severe heat. And finally the path you take along the way and how many stops you make along the way. The heat, lack of water, rolling hills, and the advice you get can result badly by affecting the outcome. A rider should make a plan and use determination to get to where they need to go."	2	2		2																					
7096	3	"The setting in the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” reflect upon the cyclist. In the story a cyclist is riding his bike and takes directions from some old men. Later he realizes the old men probably had no idea that things change overtime. He says “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left their porches since carter was in office.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist takes the old-timers “shortcut” and it takes forever to reach his destination. At the end he reaches his campsite and another person askes him for directions. This time the cyclist says “Yes, sir! I own a very good map,” and “I’d always stick to it in the future.” The cyclist’s message is to follow a map, something you know is right, not a person that @MONTH1 be lying or irresponsible."	2	2		2																					
7097	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him dehydrated and hot. He was in deserts on a bicycle with his water support running low and rough road with plenty of hills to make it hard for a bike to out come. he kept going though the heat was outrageous and dehydration beginning to overcome him.	2	1		2																					
7098	3	I think the boy should ask you directions for the place were he is going. He can reach the place without water but that is not a good thing to do.	2	2		2																					
7099	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist’s mood throughout the essay. Joe @CAPS1 starts with being happy and confident to determined yet help helpless and then to relief. Joe writes, “Things began well enough… flat roads…” This quote suggests that in the beginning, everything was okay. He started out with a “smile on the face.” (@NUM1) @CAPS2, things start to change @CAPS1 hits changing terrain. He writes, “…I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This quote states the changing terrain. He starts to lose water to keep him going, yet he pushes himself to the next “town”. Finally, when the author reaches “Gary & Wilber’s fish camp” he is relived when he sees an old guy sitting. The two men say, “know The best way to get There? “Yes sir! I own a very good map.” This reveals that Joe didn t ask for more directions which was his first mistake. In addition, changes in setting can chang a persons mood and attitude."	2	2		2																					
7100	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is in the desert it is in the summer. It affect the cyclist because he is riding a bike. For exsempl in the story he is running out of water. He is starting to git dehyjradid.	1	1		1																					
7101	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the mood and how everychange happened. For instance when the setting changed the cyclist felt different and it really affected him. Like if the setting was all sunny in a nice town then he would feel good but if he was in a dark town he wouldn’t feel very happy. So the setting really affected him.	1	1		1																					
7102	3	"After sometime into his trip he mentioned “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I believe that this setting had gotten him determined to keep on pedaling so he could live. But then he started to think he might die, but he wasnt sad or upset, he was happy. He had sort of chuckled to himself, because of the fact that he might die because he listend to some old men. In my opinion I think he was having the time of his life peddeling through this setting of California."	1	1		1																					
7103	3	"Where cyclist was gave him more disadvantages, then advantages. The advantages were their were hills to go down. Disadvantages hills to go up, water running out when he is in the middle of no where, very hot out, and is lost in the desert, doesn’t have much hope until he see's the factory. Biggest disadvantage is he is on a bike, and not in a car. So he has no @CAPS1 and has to pedel to keep going. But being in the desert on a bike with no water, and you are last, is quite bad. He is very lucky that he made it up the hill or else he would’ve died out there. And he thought he was seeing things good thing he checked it out. I think for future refrence ride in a car, don’t use a bike in the desert, its not to smart."	1	2		2																					
7104	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist because when all the cyclist is worried about is finding a place with water all he’s doing is getting scared and panicing. In other words, when he’s looking around, the setting he sees is like desert and no buildings. The story says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” when he sees that he panics and thinks he’s not gonna make it which affects him mentally."	1	1		1																					
7105	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in different ways The woman who had listen to the older men to get where she was going had made her run out water and almost died of thirst. As she was going to this place she had seen a snake “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondback” (@NUM1). She started to see things that wasn’t there."	1	1		1																					
7106	3	"He was affected by lack of water, the hills, snake in the way and the condition of the road.” The water bottles contained only a  few tantalizing sips. ” This quote explains how the lack of water was a problem. The hills affected him by they were “crippling"". The snake it was long ways on the road and he didn’t know how to get passed it . Finally the   roads were rough and you should go  over the speed limit of 55 mph. So he was affect in a lot of different ways not just one."	2	1		2																					
7107	3	"The features of the barren desert path make the cyclist quite nervous, but they also make him determined to escape them. He passes “ghost towns,” “abandoned buildings,” and diamondback snakes. These are images traditionally associated with being lost in the deserts, and would be enough to instill fear in most anyone travelling alone. The author even remarks that sadists are probably finding his story pleasing. He often mentions fears of “dropping” dead, being eaten by vultures, and, at one point, even wishing death upon himself via choking albeit jokingly. And yet he was determined to live. In spite of the odds stacked against him, he moved on, even after losing “what (he) believed to be (his) lost burst energy."" He even maintains a sense of humor throughout, writing of a diary entry that would be left behind that remarks on the wisdom of old men. In the end, when he finds a place to rest, he turns it all into a lesson he’ll surely abide by: follow the map!"	3	3		3																					
7108	3	"The cyclist is affected by the heat, the hills, and the lack of people. For example, the cyclist was growing short on water and had “wide rings of dried sweat on his on shirt,” and he could “drop from heatstroke.” The hills must have forced him to use more energy, and lasely  the land of people. If the towns still had people the cyclist wouldn’t have been as affected by the setting."	1	1		1

Features affect the cyclist by water, help, and saftey. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirsty by allowing what spit you have to circulate.” This quote so his desperate need for water by saying he sucks a on rock to drink his own spit. The rough terrain and abandoned road the old men sent him on that was out of date, made him unable to ask for directions, and to even know if he is travelling correctly. Along the road he meets a snake. Being so far away from civilization, if he was to have gotten bit then he would have no one to help save him from dyeing on the side of the road. Also, if he was to have a heatstroke he has no water and no help. Safty, help, and water are all factors which contribute to the features, and how they effect the cyclist.

7110	3	"The features of the setting make the ride for the cyclist very hard. It has a lot of hills, which would make him use more energy. Also, it is a desert, so it is very hot and dry. This makes the author need more water than he normally would. The author said “…I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The author knew that it was very dangerous to travel there without water, he said “…I could drop from heatstroke…” If the setting had been cooler there would not be so much danger."	2	2		2

Events seemed pretty bad, until the speaker became elated when they saw a @ORGANIZATION1 factory. The author was thirsty and the side of the building had “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The building was abandoned. The speaker then states “Somehow  I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope” (Kurmaskie @NUM3).

First is the ‘shorecay’ that is suggested to get    to @CAPS1, which naturally just ends up separating him from all other people and putting him in the middle of nowhere with a limited supply of water. His water shortage is the second thing that affects him because it makes him despair and feel that he is about to collapse and die. In the story, he says: ‘It really didn’t matter. I was going to die and the lards would pick me clean.’ This shows that the features at the setting made him feel hopeless."	2	2		2

This quote gives the reader information and tells us that the cyclist is having a hard time surviving through the harsh features of the setting through the harsh features of the setting. In California deserts I know from prior knowledge it is hot and dry, exspecially in the summer.

He took some taste of it. He said “It tasted like battery acide.” To me if the water is hot don’t taste it. Another thing is the land. The land went from straight to hilly. That started slowing him down. Last, is the day time. It started turning dark and he was still biking. He wanted to get as far as he could."	3	2		3

7120	3	"The features in the setting, affected the cyclist in many ways. The first way the features in the setting affected the cyclist is that the whole trail was desearted leaving him alone with no water. In the story it says “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time – say, before the last world war – but on that morning it fit the traditional defination of a ghost town, “this explains that he was alone and that the first town he visited was deserted.

7122	3	"The setting of the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" is very important to the events that occured in the  story. For example the story was set on a  highway set at @NUM1 which the cyclist was only able to do @NUM2. This is signifigant to the events of the story because since he was doing @NUM2, which by the away is a lot for a cyclist and it led to almost dehydration. Plus it was hilly. This led to the excution of the cyclist, so one could see that setting is very important to the outcome of the story."	2	2		2

He says, “I enjoyed the seranety of an early- summer evening.” At a campground in @LOCATION1, the setting is calming and relaxing. At the first town, the setting is shocking, but humorous to the cyclist and he starts to get nervous. After looking around he says. “this sight was trowoling”. The cyclist tip gets worse when he reads for the next town. “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This part of his journey affects him the most.

The cyclist feels a growing desperation as the setting around him gets progressively move bleak. In the beginning of the trip, the cyclist encounters a ghost town. ""I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" The cyclist is still thinking positively at this point in the essay. A while later, the cyclist comes across another abandoned set of buildings. He feels that this sight is ""troubling."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is worried, he is not yet depressive and pessimistic. Farther down the road, the terrain of the road changes, and he sees the sign that gives the essay its name."" The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting @NUM1. Sometimes life’s can feel so cruel."" The cyclist’s surroundings get progressively worse as he rides on, but even tually he finds a place with working water.

7126	3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist is he is riding a bike through the dessert. He says “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” So he was scortching hot peddling a bike. The road became bumpy and curry. A sign had said “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted Speed limit. The speed limit was @NUM1 and he was going @NUM2 so it must have been hard to get over all the bumps. The lastly he comes across and poisioness snake blocked the majority of the pavement infront of me.” So him dehydrated trying to get ground a snake would be terrifying.

Though the heat starting powing at the cyclists’ brain by making them see mirages, etc. The heat and entire setting made the cyclists’ travel much harder."	2	1		2																					
7128	3	"The setting affect the cyclist because in the hot heat of California in June which nobody wants to be outside. But first, was the heat which took a lot out of his body while trying to keep it cool. Then came the factor of which he had very little water when he reached the first town and in the story it said, “A tar like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” So now he has no cool water to drink when he says, “Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” So the cyclist has very little water is not having to endoor the hardest part of the ride. Then later on he makes a mention to change a paragraph if he loss consciousness. Also he talked about him might getting a heatstroke. Hinting to the fact that the setting he was in was affecting him in many different ways."	1	2		2																					
7129	3	"The setting of the essay “Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" is very dry, sandy, hot, and deserted. On his way to Yosemite he takes a “short cut"" from so he do me through the desert.

I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile of my face.” With this he arrives at the first “town” but hes wasn’t worried he had bad plenty of water he moves on. The terrain starts working against him in his search for water, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills a large high way sign jumped out at he. It read: Rough Road Ahead : Do not Exceed posted speed limit.” This lowers his confidence, especially because everything is deserted and if he has a heat stroke no one would he around to find him. He keeps up his determination we he sees the factory yet he moves on. When he see the first comp he is overwhelmed  with relief and the terrain flattens out again. When asked if he need direction he say he has his own map so he can keep stick to the terrain he knows is rest. He can keep his hopes for himself and follow a true set of directions."	3	3		3																					
7130	3	"Anyone who has ever rode a bike knows how relaxing it can truly be, but when you are forced to ride miles and miles on @CAPS3 terrain without any water, relaxation feels like an oasis, @CAPS1 through beat-up roads with dryness all around you really puts a domper on your experience, @CAPS2  it extends your need for thirst by enhancing the amount of dryness in the air and the amount of energy you are having. The ability to block all of that out and trying to focus on something easier to handle is exactly what you want to do in these situations, @CAPS3 terrain can really build character into a cyclist, but  adding the fact the amount of water he had and the dryness around him, it sounds like torture. I can only hope that if I ever become a cyclist, I never have to endure this kind of situation."	3	3		3																					
7131	3	"The cyclist, Joe Kurmaskie, had a rough time traveling to Yosemite @ORGANIZATION1’l Park. Granted he was misled, but if the conditions of the terrain and if the climate were working for him it wouldve made life a whole lot easier. Not only was it hot, being in a desert in California in June, but he only had one water bottle. One water bottle @MONTH1 have lasted a little longer if it was a straight shot through, but it wasn’t. The roads went up, down, there were hills, there were towns-ghost towns at that. The only water he could pump from the pump was scalding hot and tasted acidic. Also, he wouldn’t have lost as much energy if it was a straight shot. It’s easy to say that he literally roughed it, having to resort to putting rocks in his mouth to circulate saliva. All in all, he was very determined to work through the very unfortunate conditions he had working against him, and very lucky to survive it. "	2	3		3																					
7132	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways For example, the fact that he is pedaling a bike “through the high deserts of California in June, make the intensity level of the story very high.

7133	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist by lack of water, poisonous snake, the condition of the rode for example the lack of water affected the cyclist because he couldn't make it wi thout water he could of passed out if he didnt have water. Another example of how the setting affected the cyclist would be the poisonous snake if he would have  goten bitten he could have died cause there would be nobody to help him. And the last example of how the setting affected him would be the conditon of the road because it make it tougher for the cyclist to get to his destination with hills and windy rounds this is how I think the setting affected  the  cyclist."	2	2		2																					
7134	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that if it’s hot and your riding a long way you need a lot of water so you don’t  dehydrated. Also it can affect your vision cause you looking at the sun. Another way cyclist can get affected by the setting is because what if the road is all bumpy and just not in good shape it can affect the way they ride there bike.	1	1		1																					
7135	3	" The story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by @PERSON1 had some statements that we were kind of pointless to put in.

7136	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is, the setting. The cyclist is out in the dessert, in two-hundred degree weather. With very little water.

''Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn`t been off their porch in decades.'' This quote talks about how the setting (@NUM1 degree weather, dessert) can @CAPS1 him. Also, he listened to someone that didn`t know what they were talking about. In conclusion that is how the features of setting affected the cyclist.  "	2	2		2																					
7137	3	The settings of the story is very desert like what I mean by that is its the desert and its hot and he really had to push his self to make it. The condition at the rode are very rough and has a lotof shape turn it in. Apart in the story he gets a boost of energy and pedal as hard as he can down a hill and then relaxes. This is the setting and is summary of the story.	0	0		0																					
7138	3	"The setting affected the cyclist because the condition of his surrounding it was hot so he got dehydrated more and needed more water.

7139	3	"Features of the setting affect the cyclist in a great way His journey would not be as difficult if these factors had not crossed his path. Climate, location, and population all have an effect on the cyclist. In the story, it is told that the cyclist is in the dry climate in California, in the heat of June.Their is also a lack of water, some must pace his sips carefully. Therefore also few towns, making it hard to get good advice and supplies and supplies. The cyclsit also comes across a snake, making him affected by native wild life.  The dry climate and lack of water affects him by having doubt. The cyclist is constantly worried about passing out and dying of dehydration. The cyclist also gets doubts when he sees the road signs reminding him how slow he is going. The snake also has a depressing effect about his dangers on his journey. All of these things in the setting affected the cyclist. His journey does teach you though, that trough determination you will be rewarded. You have to want things bad enough and put the effort into it. The author also teaches you to always have a positive attitude to get success."	3	3		3

But when he did get to the town that was abandon to. until he found hope and seeing a man in a chair 	2	2		2																					
7141	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist by not being in town. I say this Because the cyclist talks about “old timeres who haven't left the contines of their porches since carter was in office."" So that means he dousen't know were he's at."	1	1		1																					
7142	3	"In the cyclists journey to Yosemite, several factors hinder him from reaching it. The first is obviously the false information given to him by the elders. The second is that because the information wasn’t true, the cyclist had an insufficient amount of water. This made him dehydrated. The last is the fact that the route given to him included obstacles such as snakes, rocky roads, and old ghost towns and abandoned buildings which made the cyclist less confident. Those are the features of the setting which affected the cyclist"	2	2		2																					
7143	3	The setting affects the cyclist because one he should have stack to his own map. He should have packed an extra bottle of water. @NUM1 not take any advice from people that haven’t left the porch in years.	2	1		2																					
7144	3	"The setting affects the cyclist mood in the story the cyclist takes a short cut with many abandon towns, and buildings as well as a bumpy, terrain. When he came to a fork in his path that had a water pump he immediately began to pump it the water was not good for drinking. He was determined to make it to the next town. “I could make that” he said. Because of the ghost town and the old pump he had to continue on. When the cyclist came to a sign in the road warning him about the road a hed he began to get depressed, “I was sad”. Finally when he reached @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 Fish Camp he was thankful and wanted to show his gratitude. The setting can affect a cyclist by his mood at first the cyclist is determined but as the setting gets worse his mood and hopes go down the drain. At the end when the setting is bright so is his mood."	2	3		3																					
7145	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclists because he was thirsty and it was hot and he was almost out of water and he almost died because when he was drinking the water and he hit a bump and spit got lodged in his throat and tiring hills it seemed to never end.	1	1		1																					
7146	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he wasnt pre pared in the beginning, the cyclist got directions from an old man who hadnt left his porch in years so he wouldnt know what had changed. Then the cyclist starts his journey with not a lot of water. When he got to the second town “I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.’ This quote means that he wasn’t expecting hills, he thought it was going o be a flat way. Also in the @NUM1 degree whether with limited water supply, he couldnt ride up and down hills. Going down the hills gave him a break. Thats how the cyclist was affected by the settings features."	2	1		2																					
7147	3	"Alot of factors effected the cyclist. Temperature, terrain, directions all gave the cyclist doubt. The temperature through the high deserts of california left the cyclist feeling hot, parched and irratable. Through the story, he had all but a few slips of his water left. Knowing your running low of water “to feel sorry for himself” The cyclist had biked so far the terrain started to change from flat to “rolling hills”. This could impact someone greatly who has never biked on different levals before. Lastly, the feeling of hoped could have effected him the most. Not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome. Having just liesurly taken instructions by an old man cost the cyclist hours of torture. The author did a great job using hyperbole to exagerate the cyclists feeling of lost hope . He also used very detailed text to paint the reader a picture. These literay elements made it easier for me to understand the effect of the temp, terrain and hope had on the biclist."	3	2		3																					
7148	3	"The features of the setting really affect the cyclist. He is led into false pretenses by the immediate surroundings. Little does he know that it would bring him into danger? When he comes to a rock in the road and finds that the water pumps are not good he is in serious danger. In the reading it says “The sun was beginning to heat down, but it hardly noticed. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” The setting let the cyclists mind wonder so much that he didn’t even realize the heat."	1	1		1

During his time of need the cyclist says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise old men their wisdom.” The cyclist has a lack of necessities in the features around him and is letting his pride fall down; giving up on hope. When the cyclist finds hope, “And drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.” The cyclist was astonished of what he had stumbled onto and appreciated that he was still alive. The cyclist should not have taken the old peoples advice for granted, but will now look onto people’s sense of directions."	3	3		3																					
7150	3	Setting affects many things in stories. The setting in this story affected the cyclist. The setting was very hot and it slowed him do wn a lot. For example he said he was doing 55 miles	1	1		1																					
7151	3	The setting in the story was the “high deserts of California in June.” At first the cyclist had seemed really confident and excited about his journey. It was during it that had changed his mind. The cyclist was running low on his water supply's so he stops and pumps water from this water pump but all he gets is this acid taste. So he is on his way to the nearest town which is @NUM1 miles away and he thinks he can make it. So he is heading towards the nearest town when the terrain starts changing. It changes from flat road to short rolling hills. During this time the cyclist starts loosing hope. He thinks that he is going to die of dehydration and the birds are going to pick him apart. Then when he thought he couldn’t make it he saw a sign that said “Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp” He ran into the shop and took long drinks from the sink in the bathroom and when he went out of the store an older gentle men asked him if he needed help and he said no I have a really good map. The thot temperature and rolling hills have a negative effect on the cyclist. I mean he goes from being confident to thinking he is seeing mirages and dieing. It states in the story “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage” and “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean” So this brought self doubting behavior. 	3	3		3																					
7152	3	The features of the setting of were the cyclist are affect them very drastically. They need a water supply and if they don’t have one they might dehydrate or even die. They need shade trees because it keeps the sun from beaming down on them so hard. They also need to cycle when its not as hot outside so that just incase there water gets low there is a better chance of survival. It would be great if there was someone with you to help if you get hurt. There should be buildings near by just incase of an emergency. It might even be good to carry a cell phone.	1	1		1																					
7153	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more than one way. The first features were a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule. These items gave the cyclist a feeling of doubts. They made him begin to think he had taken the wrong route when he saw these things were outdated. Then, he couldn’t get any cold,clean water out of the pumps to save his life. This was the first obstacle which affected him. The next features of the setting which caused a problem were the tumbleweeds and ""a ridiculously large snake.” They made the cyclist scared and caused him to go around these things. You can tell he wass scared because he quoted “I eased past.” When the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, the cyclist’s journey became exhausting,never ending, and difficult. Two more things affected the cyclist. These two things consist of the signs. One of which read “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" and the other “GARY AND WILBER'S FISH-IF you want bait for the big ones, we’re your BEST BET.""The first sign affected him in a negative way and caused him to become a little angry and frustrated because he was tired and dehydrated and the rough road ahead gave him no hope. The second sign led him to water which was the one thing that would make things better so it had a positive affect. These are features that had an affect on the cyclist."	3	3		3																					
7154	3	"The setting affected the cyclist: due to the changes in terrain. A rough spot for the cyclist was when the terrain changed from a flat stretch to rolling hills. The author wrote, “I tolld on""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was pushing through the rough and it was not an easy stretch to get through. Another place in the cyclist's trip that was difficult was when he saw the abandoned juice factory. The narration states, “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The context clues that provide information that it wasn't easy are the words ""long"" and ""crippling."" @CAPS1 of those words provide feelings of being drug on through the rough setting of the cyclist's trip."	3	3		3

Where they said there would be a town it was more like a ghost town. The day that the cyclist was riding was very hot and he was riding through the desert, @CAPS1 made it worse. Because of the heat he was drinking his water regularly to stay hydrated. This meant he was running out of it fast since the old men had given him directions through places that were no longer open he couldn’t get more water. The cyclist also had to go over roads that were in bad condition @CAPS1 slowed him down even more. Those features at the setting affected the cyclist a lot on his trip."	2	3		3																					
7156	3	"Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. In the beginning, he cannot get water and becomes dehydrated, then, he goes on a rough ride and loses more energy. Then he finds the bait and gets water. All of these greatly affect the cyclists condition."	1	1		1

He didn’t have a lot of water because there were no rivers or water supply because of the desert surrounding him. At the end he finds a store which affects him because he gets a cool drink and same supplies which helped him. So in the end his surroundings destroyed him and then relieved him.	2	2		2																					
7158	3	"The bicyclist was riding to Yosemite National Park and on the way ran out of water. ""The wate bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Then, hills came into play which makes you more tired and thirsty. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” The rider didn’t think he would live “I was going to die and the birds would pick he clean” but he found a place to get water “drank deeply from the sink” and finished his ride."	2	2		2																					
7159	3	"In the story “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affected the cyclist a lot. At first, when the cyclist set off in the morning, the conditions were great. It was breezy with shade from trees and rivers. Then, after a few hours, the cyclist was in the desert with bumpy hills. In the story, the speaker states, “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The condition of the roads and not having water really affected the cyclist. It took more energy to get up and down the hills without any shade which ment that he needed more water which he didn’t have any. The condition of the setting really affect the cyclist and if it was easier to bike, they might have not be so dehydrated."	3	3		3																					
7160	3	"The features of the setting was affect the cyclist by disturb them to ride in road, limite their speed, and make their distance longer than the original travel plan. For example, the features at the setting was disturb the cyclist to ride in road because it tells them where they can go and where they can’t and they shouldn’t do this or that such as the sign of “no entering” or “one way”. Second, it’s limite their speed because if the features of the setting it said the limited speed is @NUM1, the cyclist only can ride about @NUM1 and go no more further which can make the cyclist longer time to reach the place that they want to go and couldn’t travel faster. Third, it make their distance longer than the original travel plan or exit or how fast they can rode. Such as the sign of “Rough road ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit”. Therefore, the features of the setting was affect the cyclist during the journal.  "	1	1		1

The lack of water made him very desperate, especially when he came to the welch’s grape juice factory. The  building-abandoned years earlier-had been a welch’s grape juice factory and bottling plant."" This despersion, after he had come to the abondoned factory, was followed by dissapointment and a vague sense of hopelessness expressed by the phrase, ""I hung my head"" after he had found the abondoned factory. These are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
7163	3	"No water, rough terran, bad info-all are reasons why the boy isn’t doing so well I said no water because he is dehidrated but needs to soae his water. Also he could die from heat exauston. I also said rough terrain because he could fall and get hurt with no one around to help. And to top it off he took info from old people that didn’t know what they were talking about. Theas leave all examples about the essay that support my writing."	2	2		2																					
7164	3	"In the story by Joe Kurmaskie it tells about a cyclists challenge through the heated deserts of California in June. The cyclist had started out with confidence, followed by determination, then relief. The setting affected the cyclist physically and mentally. First, listening to the old men was stupid, then taking the trip not certain if you would have enough water, and lastly traveling through the desert in June. He started getting a little doubtful with himself as well, that won’t help much with bringing success of the trip. Once he had made it to a fish camp an old man even older then the men who gave him the false information told him he knew how to get to Yosemite, but the young man did the best thing and told him he already knew how to get there. He didn’t need to be traveling out in the desert heat for hours that’s just unhealthy"	2	2		2																					
7165	3	"A cyclist is affected by many things when riding, most being features of the setting. One feature of the setting that can have an affect is the terrain. If the terrain is rough then the cyclist could have a more difficult time maintaining control of the bike, especially if he is not a professional rider. For example, the author of the essay on page @NUM1 titled: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, had a hard times on the rougher roads partly due to his level of experience. Another aspect of the environment that can have an affect on a cyclist is the climate. Most people who go cycling ??? know anything about the sport know how to dress for it to keep their body at a comfortable temperature but sometimes the weather plays tricks  on us. The cyclist could get caught in a sudden heat wave to drop in temperature."	3	2		3																					
7166	3	"The features of the setting inhance the cyclist’s desparate spirit. Throughout the whole journey the cyclist is by himself and there are no people, cars, or buildings around. This made him much more desparate because if he would fall of dehydration there would be no one to help him and he would just die. Also, he came upon things such as “Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant” which got his hopes up, but would soon crush his spirits. These events made him much more desparate because he had no support from anywhere and nothing to fall back on in a life or death situation."	2	2		2																					
7167	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First of all as he was riding about @NUM1 miles up the road, he saw that the terrain was changing and that scared him, he says “This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly “(kurmaskie @NUM2). He is saying that as the things around him began to change the more he got scared. And he kept drinking a lot of water just to bring down his fear. Another example is after he had left the sign that told him not to pass. He says “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (kurmaskie @NUM3). This is also an example of fear that started over coming him, when he saw even more changes. He wasn’t going to stop because of the road changes and the fact that his water was almost gone he still had the courage to go further. The setting brought him fear but he made it through."	2	3		3																					
7168	3	In the story the cyclisst had ran out of water. He had mentioned it tasted like battery acid. The surroundings affected him by looking around and not seeing anybody around for miles. That brings despair. Also a desert with the hot sun beating down on him and just the sand and catus all around. Now if you saw that you would think of no water or shade of noting because the desert is put to image when you hear those descriptions.	1	1		1																					
7169	3	"The features of the setting, in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affects the cyclist. The setting affect him both physically and mentally. In the story the setting provides no water for the cyclist making him weak. In the mental aspect he is greatly affected by the features of the setting. An example of this is when so see the abandoned welch's factory and sees the picture of a boy ""pour a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth”. This made him hang his head as he rode on. He is also thinking to himself that he will die out of here. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	2	1		2																					
7170	3	I believe the first photograph closely relates to the story ”As worry” because the authors son suffs a lot. And it shows what he and his friends @MONTH1 look like. Also it shows the surf boards emphasizing there surfers. That is what I believe about the first picture. The second are only relate a little cause it has a surfer surfing. So in conclusion the first photograph is moreaccurate to the story than the second photo.	1	1		1																					
7171	3	"When the bicyclist was trying to find Yosemite he stumbled into a million setting. One in the begining when he was talking to the old men on the porch and having him set of into the distance of nothing but dessert. “one rameshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.” It’s only him.“ At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake – it really did look like ma diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. Tumble weed usually mean's desert. He also saw the @CAPS1 grape juice factory and the bait store where he finally found someone else to give him directions."	1	2		2

Also because of the heat he could have dehydration of heat strokes. Lastly because it was a desert the wild animals like the snakes and lizards could hurt or posion him and he could die that is how the setting of the story affected the cyclist"	2	2		2																					
7173	3	"The cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by @PERSON1 suffers from some hardship while riding through the desert. The features of the setting affected the cyclist by having no water to drink because it was a desert there was no vegetation that means there is no water so he was becoming dehydrated. Also the setting of the towns he went to had no living organisms or people so he also couldn’t quench his thirst there. In one town there was a spiket but the water was gross and hasn’t been pumped in a while. Then he comes to the Welch’s juice factory which was abandoned and from there he thought he was done for but then he finally come to a shop were there are bathrooms were he drinks water from the sink and he is relieved. Also the rocky roads affected him because he barely had any water left, and rocky tent to take more strength and endurance."	2	3		3																					
7174	3	"In the passage DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the desert’s feature did not have any positive affects on the cyclist. The desert contained ""rolling hills."" When a cyclist goes over hills it takes more energy due to the laws of gravity. Because the cyclist used more energy to go over the hills he only had enough energy to ""feel sorry"" for himself. The more hills, the more energy lost, the more tired he became. The desert was also hot, and dry. Obviously, since he was in the ""deserts of California in June."" @CAPS1 the would make him become thirsty. He did stop for water but a ""tarlike substance"" came out instead. When he again stopped later for water it was ""cool"" and most likely refreshing. Riding his bike in the hilly, dry, hot desert the cyclist became tired and thirsty."	3	2		3																					
7175	3	"The features of the settings effect the cyclist by obstacles in the settings. A obstacle is a object in the way of you and were your trying to go.

7177	3	"The features in the story tell me that it was in a very dry, not populated area. It says that there were rolling hills, in a desert of California, and that it was dry. I think those things affected the cyclist by dehydrating him. Going up and down hills can be very tiring, especially when you don’t have a lot of water left, and need to save some. The quote “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” tells me a lot about the story. In a desert in California in June during the summer is a very brave and stupid thing to do. It s twice as hot during the summer."	3	0		2

In the text it says, ''Never accept travel advice, from a collection of old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office,” this means that the cyclist did not have good directions. Because the road might of changed and the old timers do not know because they been sitting on there porches all the time.

The setting caused him to doubt himself and the men and also it kept him from having the energy needed to get to where he was going. Where the cyclist was riding, in California, affected him physically. It was hot, and he had no watter. This caused him to become tired and frustrated. The setting affected him emotionally as well. He started off fine, but as he went on, and as the road slowly changed to hills, he began to get frustrated and angred that he listened to the men. As he saw no buildings in sight for many miles, he began to lose his determination as well as hope. Lastly, when he saw the sign “Gary and @CAPS1 Fish Camp” he started to regain hope and become less frustrated.

The text first mentions that, “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind.” This shows that the cyclist felt in saccure and was starting to upset him. Another example from the text that describes the cyclist is, “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.” You can see through the cyclists that he was frustrated that the water from the pumps were lame. This also could have sparked fear in the cyclist because he was running out of water. He was terrified that since the water tasted like, “battery acid,” that he wouldn’t last much longer. In- conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. "	1	1		1																					
7183	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey. The rusty water pump, highway sign and abandoned juice factory all seemed to make his trip more difficult than it already was. First of all, when the author stumbles along a “ramshackle shed” surrounded by “several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lames mule”, he is anylous to check the pump for well-needed water. When he finds that he is out of luck and cannot drink the bitter tasting water, his hope droop a little. It is as if the sun were taunting him, telling him that he can’t make it. Secondly, he passes a large road sign reading “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”. Once again he begins to feel hopeless, but then turns his angst into determination to finish his journey. He says “sometimes life can be so cruel” as he notices the speed limit to be @NUM1, but he continues on, pedaling hard. Lastly, the author sees a lone building in the distance and almost doesn’t believe his eyes. It turns out to be not only his last hope for water, but an abandoned grape juice factory. He reflect on the irony of his position by saying that his situation “should please all sadists” reading about it. Therefore, the features of the setting affected the reader by highlighting the negativity of his situation, which in turn drives him to continue pedaling."	3	3		3

One way it affected him was that the temperature was very hot and by it being hot outside his water wouldn’t stay cool. This is a problem because you need nice, cool, refreashing water to stay hydrated. Another way was when he hit a fork in the road. He didn’t know which way to go. All he saw was one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling. Last but not least this water pump wasn’t working very well so he got down on his hands and knees and started pumping. The water wouldn’t cool down. He tried a drop or two and the water tasted like battery acid. Those are some features of the setting that affected the cyclist on his journey."	2	2		2																					
7185	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways. First the rolling hills make it hard to pedal over the land. ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" shows that the terrain was changing into a more difficult course. One long crippling hill,"" also shows how the hills had an effect on the cyclist. Another feature of the setting was the desert and the high temperatures. This caused the cyclist to become dehydrated. ""Trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state"" and ""I could drop from heatstroke"" show me how hot the cyclist was. One final feature that has on effect on the cyclist was the old abandoned factory. The sight of the boy with a refreshing glass of juice makes the cyclist lose hope and he doubts he will survive. ""I hung my head"" and ""abandoned factory of juices and dreams"" tell how the cyclist lost all hope at the sight of the building. All of these features of the setting have negative affects on the cyclist."	3	3		3																					
7186	3	"The setting of the area where the cyclist was biking effects him because it makes him weaker. Since the cyclist takes the long route, He is in the desert for a longer period of time. Being in extreme heat can cause a person to suffer from major dehydration. We know this was the case for the cyclist because he says, “…but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst…” This @CAPS1 is saying that the cyclist put stones in his mouth to get his mind off of how thirsty he was. I think this @CAPS1 is explaining exactly how dehydrated the cyclist actually was. If he was willing to put filthy stones in his mouth to help him get through his dehydration, he was pretty thirsty. Another thing that effected how thirsty the cyclist got was how hard he worked which was also a feature of the setting since during the end of his trip, he met rough terrain, he exerted more energy which made him sweat even more than he was. This made him @NUM1 more dehydrated. This story is explaining how the features of your environment can either make or break you."	2	2		2																					
7187	3	"There are several features of the setting which affect the cyclist one is the fact that he is traveling on a hot day in June. “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The heat was getting to the cyclist and he was scared he might get heatstroke. The terrain was also not very ideal for a cyclist on a hot @DATE1. “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The cyclist was tired and the hills were making it worse. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” The cyclist was running out of water quickly and there was nowhere close to get more.

The features of the setting affected him in that sense. Also the snake affected the cyclist. The snake caused the cyclist to be afraid which added to the fact that the cyclist was dehydrating. Another way that the features of the setting affected the cyclist was the Welch's Grape Juice Factory. The factory caused the cyclist to be even more thirsty and think about dehydration even more in the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of setting affect the cyclist a lot."	3	2		3

Then he got to a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, but it was abandoned years earlier and he was becoming weak and dehydrated. He thought he would drop from a heatstroke. At the end of his ride, he reached a fish camp where he found water to drink. A man asked him where he was going and the cyclist told him. Then the man asked him, “Know the best way to get there?” The man was much older than the other old men that gave the cyclist advice. So the cyclist told the man “yes, sir: I own a very good map”. The man realized throughout the setting on his journey, that he would never accept advice from old-timers again."	1	1		1																					
7191	3	In the essay “Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit” the setting affected the cyclist sense of direction. The cyclist knew where he was going and how to get there but the old men told him their “short-cut.” It ruined his own sense of direction because he was taking out-dated directions from “old-timers that hadn’t left their porches since Carter was in office.” That is how the setting affected the cyclist in the's essay.	1	1		1

When exposed for a long time, exercising, and running out of water, the effect is even greater. In addition, the change in terrain and road surface would have an effect on the cyclist. Traveling on a flat road requires much less effort then climbing hills. If the road is also rough, the biker has to work even harder to push the up the hill. There is also the mental effort of not tipping the bike on the uneven surface. Finally, there are not any buildings in sight. When someone is dehydrated but has no water, they are desperate to find some. However, if there is nothing they know of nearby, they will start to lose hope. Once they lose hope they won’t try as hard to keep going and they will lose some of their strength. Considering all of the things negatively affecting the cyclist, it is amazing that he managed to push through and reach a source of water. "	2	3		3

The quote, “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” shows that he was troubled by having to go over the hills. As you can see the setting was very influental to the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
7199	3	I the essays the features of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him hope. The cyclist takes directions by a few old men on a porch. The directions seem incorrect at first.

7200	3	"The features of the setting around the cyclist affected him to the point of exauhstion and dehydration. The cycllist being exauhsted and dehydrated,or tired and thirsty, was beging to wear as the setting went from being flat to many ups and downs. The cyclist exlained the change by saying, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist’s idea presented here is that he was to find new challenges when riding the hill of this californian desert rollar coaster. His water supply was thinning from the heat and the hills were tiring him beyond reason. All this cyclist could hope for was the blessing of a water refill and the shade of a puffy cloud."	2	2		2

As the day went on and all he could find was abondoned buildings he began to worry a bit water running low he come upon “one ram shackled shed, several rusty pumps” no sign of life. He realiced that his trip was going to be rough. The environment and risk of death gave him the determination he needed to push forward. Although he was fearful of death from dehydration, he knew “travelling through the high deserts of California in June” his only chances of survival was to keep going. The mans surroundings were what had pushed him to keep biking until he found the fish camp.

I began breaking the ride clan into distances I could see on the horizon” The cyclist had to do this because they were having trouble riding since they were thirsty and the ride was very boring. This makes the ride seem larges so it also makes it harder to ride. Also in the essay it states, ""One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps” This affeted the cyclist because after seeing this and later realizing he could’t drink the water, he was more thirsty since he was running out of water.

7205	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. When he was going up hill it was harder for him to pedal. The hot summer day was breaking him down. He was getting dehydrated because he had a little bit of water left. It said he was trying to keep his balance in my dehydrated state. He felt like giving up.	1	1		1																					
7206	3	"Features of the cyclist affected the cyclist in many ways. One was the heat. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 that California is called, “the sunshine state”, I can infer that it was very hot. Another feature that affected the cyclist was when he thought he could get some water but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. This is said in. This is said in paragraph @NUM2. This is how features of the setting affected the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
7207	3	The setting features affected the cyclist because it was a conflict. It was a conflict because it was hot and he was lost. I was a confict that he was hot because he had a limited amount of water. Which he could get anymoe of because he was lost. The heat causes people to get thirsty but he couldn't because he was limited in water.Another conflict was that he was lost. This was a conflict that because he needed to be some where.	1	1		1																					
7208	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he rode through the heat scorching desert of California, he rode over @NUM1 miles on bike to get to Yosemite, and he almost ran out of water on the journey. What kept him going on was the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite."	1	1		1																					
7209	3	"There are many ways the cyclist is affected throughout the essay by the setting. As he first enters the “short cut” that the old men give him he is confidenc. When he arrives at the first town and sees that it is like a ghost town he does not fret but continues on his journey in confidence. As he got to the second stop his lack of water began to set in, “I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water with all my strength. This shows he will work hard and is in need of water. As the cyclist past another place with no hope of water he placed stones in his mouth because he once heard it helped get your mind off thirst when he had just about lost hope from travelling through the hot @CAPS1 desert with no water he found one lost drive in him when he saw a store with water. Though this was a hot harsh setting it created inspiration for him to keep going and push through the hard times and survive."	3	2		3																					
7210	3	"The cyclist in Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit was greatly affected by the setting. There were no buildings or people to the town anywhere. This emptiness meant that there was no help from anyone and he could die with out anyone knowing. Also the setting seems to be very dry and have desert like conditions, without water the cyclist would be dehydrated and could suffer from a heat stroke. Also the setting seems to be very hot. The heartt also makes the cyclist physically dehydrated and mentally considers the logic of a heat stroke at the time."	2	2		2																					
7211	3	"The features of the setting had greatly impacted the cyclist. The heat, animals, and terrain had slowed him down throught his journey. The heat had slowed him down because he didn’t have enough water to keep his boby moving normaly, and he said he had slowed him down because he had to sneak around it so it wouldn’t bite him. The hills had affected the cyclist because it takes a lot of energy to go up there, when he said he couldn’t see anything in sight."	3	3		3																					
7212	3	"The arid, bare, and rough terrain of the desert affected the cyclist during his journey to Yosemite in the story “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit”. The cyclist’s expedition was hindered due to many obstacles. The dryness was a huge problem during his journey. “.I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This exert explain the hot, arid climate of where he was cycling. This climate decreased the rate of travel the cyclist intended to exert. Since the cyclist was riding in the desert, there wasn’t many towns present. When the cyclist did approach a town, it was abandoned. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me” (@NUM2). After riding through the desert, the cyclist would have wanted a nice rest stop, but all of them were ghost towns. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills “(@NUM1). Cycling for hours in a hot desert with limited water wasn’t enough of a challenge; the flat land was replaced with hills. The cyclist is exhausted from all the other obstacles that the desert confronted him with; the rough terrain affected his journey since his rate was reduced. In conclusion, many factors negativly affected the cyclist expedition to Yosemite. The dry, bland, and hilly terrain of the desert hindered his journey"	3	2		3																					
7213	3	"I belive the setting of an area can affect the mind when put is certin situations. In the reading the man is cycling and he sees no one, he is almost out of water and cant se a house or a person as far as he can see. This is scary and gives te feeling of helplessness but if he would be in @LOCATION1 and go past cars, people on the street and cars he would be calmer he could get water at only building along his ride the tempature would be cold there far he would drink less and go further. This would have changed his mood."	1	1		1																					
7214	3	Well in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limits by @PERSON1 the setting affects you because if you cant see any thing for miles and you are running out of water it has a sycological effect on you. You can start to panick like he did when it stoped in the old house and all that came out of the pump was battery acid. Also you don know exactly where you are so that also affects u because you don’t know where to go or if you should turn back or what. If I was this person the features around me would have a lot of effect on me. 	2	2		2

In the beginning of the essay she was happy that she was getting a shortcut ""I followed their device and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.” He thought he knew where he was going “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" When she entered the first town, “this sight was troubling”. I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength, “she was beginning to get worried/ run out of water, the next town was “only eighteen miles down the road."" He was now at the dehightrated state. “ The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" Then he saw a building, but it was no longer open, so he got back on his bike, but his thoughts had changed he was now upset and expecting to die. He then saw a store, “Gary and wilbers fish camp”. He went in drank cool water and then on used his own map, rather than old guys."	2	2		2																					
7216	3	"There were many features of the setting that had affected the cyclist. One of the features was the lack of water. This had made the cyclist dehydrated and not think right. It had also made the cyclist have less energy. An example is, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” @CAPS1 feature is the heat. The heat had made the cyclist thirsty and sweaty. An example is “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage…” @CAPS1 example is, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The features of the setting had affected the cyclist in many ways."	2	2		2																					
7217	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclcist. The first feature that affected the cyclist was the desert terain, it very hot and there were no trees to provide shade. This affected the cyclist because he got very hot and thirsty. So he drank more water than usual. Secondly, he was running out of water because he was drinking more than usual so he had to conserve his water, which was making him became dehydrated. That all the towns we past through were ghost towns with no running fresh water, so this extremely dissapointed him, it also furthered his dehydration. Just when the cyclist was losing hope he found a small bait shop and got into the shade and finnaly got water to drink. So after all those dissapointments he found hope, in the small bait shop, which gave him the strength and mental boost to continue on with his journey to Yosemite national park."	3	3		3																					
7218	3	"The features of the setting made the cyclist’s journey even longer and more strenuous. The reason it being in such a remote area did not help. For example the people who still lived in that remote area were probably as old as the cyclist grandparents and the directions were horrible. Also, the fact that their were no new shops or areas or rest for the cyclist to go to; the water pump he found was old and nasty and the only building he saw was abandoned. Also ther factor was the rough terrain. It  being froit the cyclist was already very fatigued by lack of water and tiredness the terrain was long, bumpy and just horrible all together. Finally, the last factor was where he was bicycling in California on a @CAPS1 summer day and he being on a which had no n.c(but which bike does) did not help at all. These are how the features affect the cyclist journey."	3	3		3																					
7219	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the rougher the terrain got the more the cyclist had to strain to make it. For example, when the terrain turned to hills, the cyclist had to struggle to climb the hills which caused him to use more of his energy. Also, if the terrain was flat and smooth, the cyclist had less problems making the long journey. For instance, if the cyclist had less strain on him then he would not be as tired and would not drink as much water. In conclusion, that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	2	2		2

So thats outing  the feature of the setting would affect the cyclsit."	1	1		1																					
7222	3	"In the adventures of the cyclist the setting is not only what developes the character but, that what affects how he pushes himself to not give up, even when he feels helpless. This is one example of how the cyclist is affected, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June,"" With that information you can observe how this harsh setting creates problems for him physicaly because his body needs water. Which he is extremely limited and doesn't savor it very well. These issues create the problem of dehydration, and when mentally you think your going to die without water. You start to panic and lose control over yourself."	3	2		3

You can tell that the features of the setting disappointed him because every time he got to a town he couldn’t get water. In the text it states, ''I got down on my hands & knees working the handle of the rusty water pump a for like substance oozed out followed by @NUM1 degree brackish water that tasted like battery acid.’’ You know the setting disappoints him when he sees the terrain he has to cross as well. You can tell who he says ''At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridicuously large snake.'' The narrarator was disappointed that he listened to the directions of the elder rather than use his map. Joe Kurmaskie does a great job of making one narrarator faced & how he felt about them."	3	2		3																					
7225	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist b/c the route, that the cyclist was taking there was a rough road him to travel. The cyclist took bad advice from some old men that hadn’t left off their porches for decades.  also, as he got into his long journey he began to notice what the advice the old men had given him was bad was bad advice, the cyclist was headed to Yosemite & he had gotten some advice from ???(not legible onwards)"	1	1		1																					
7226	3	"When the cyclist first set off, he was doing fine, he had plenty of water. As he kept going, and sort of got of cause, he began to come into the desert region. He was hot, and he was ruunning out of water. This was making him dehydrated. Also, seeing the tumbleweeds, and lack of vegetation probably made him even worse mentally, because he was maybe thinking he was never going to get free from that. When he saw the fish bate shop though, he was probably relieved that he was going to be saved,    "	2	2		2																					
7227	3	There are many ways that a cyclist will be affected and one of these are the setting. The setting affects them because if it is short smooth setting the ride will be easy. But if it is long bumpy rough roads it will be harder to control the bike which means that the cyclist’s job will be harden this is how a cyclist is affected by his or her settings.	1	1		1																					
7228	3	"The cyclist ran into rough settings on the way to @ORGANIZATION1 park. The first is the town he came to was a ghost town. Then he was running out of water when he ran by tambleweeds, and a large snake in front of him. He had no more water and there was rough roads ahead of him and he came across a juice factory. No one was there and he was out of water he did not know how longer it would be until he came tp another town. That is why I say that how the features of the setting affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
7229	3	"The features of the setting have a very negative effect on the cyclist. According to the old men the cyclist would pass by a few towns if he took the route they told him. But every town the cyclist came to was deserted. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” Because the towns were deserted, the cyclist water supply was dwindling because there was no place where he could get more water. He became dehydrated and kept pushing himself to find a place where there was fresh water. “Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” Once he found some pebble and thought about sucking on them because it helps to slow down dehydration. But he didn’t because he thought he would choke on them. The setting around him also made him have negative thoughts. “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Because the setting was a hot, deserted, desert it had a very negative effect on the cyclist. If he hadn’t been running out of water I don’t think that the effect of the setting would have been as bad. But because he did run out of water it made the effects much worse."	3	2		3																					
7230	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One reason I say this is because he ran out of water and he could dehidrate. Also looking for water slowed him dsown more. Another reason I say this is because the man gave him the wrong directions, which got him lost and confused. That is how the setting affected the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
7231	3	"It is said that, ""experience is a good substitute for @CAPS1 instinct.” This means if someone knows how to deal with the environment they're in they can survive even if they weren't born with the animal instinct that come with the territory. However, even the most experienced person can be overcome by the extreme weather conditions they live in. In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the experienced cyclist decides to take a long, difficult, and dangerous trip. His ride will take him a long the long desert paths of California with a limited water supply. This is the major element that and him in the story. Because he listened to same old men he went without water for most of his trip. Between his constant excersise, extreme heat, and lack of water, dehydration hit him fast. A common side effect of dehydration is hallucination, which the cyclist knew. It says in the essay, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn`t mirage.” This represents his knowledge and experience in the matter, and showed that he was adapt to his environment through experience. A similar story to this is jack @LOCATION2's, “To @CAPS2 a fire” where the man is also pitted against extremes at nature through the vukor, but the elements still ovetook him. Both stories represents man's quest for adventure, and also the canstrant struggle for survival that people face. "	3	3		3

7233	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist most on the fact that it strained him out the hydrated state. It made him unable to operate at his full power/efficiency. It deprived him of the little energy he had in him to begin with. That is how the setting affected him.	1	1		1																					
7234	3	The setting affects the cyclist very strongly. The desert and heat with no water cause him to get dehydrated. The rolling hills and rough terrain tire him out. In the story it says “and growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This shows that the heat and terrain could cause him to over heat and live a heat stroke.	1	1		1																					
7235	3	"The temperature of the place that the cyclist was riding through affected him very much. The temperature caused the cyclist to sweat. This affected him because he would get thirsty and eventually he ran out of water. For example in the text he says “the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips” and then it goes on to say, “I could drop from from a heat stroke.” This showed how it affected him because he thought he is going to drop from the heat."	2	1		2																					
7236	3	Features of the setling affected the cyclist were the harsh & hot climate and terrain. The author clearly wrote how “the sun was beating down on him and how he almost died from dehydration.	1	1		1																					
7237	3	"The features of the setting do affect the cyclist. If the road is rough you have to have the right bike. Then if you get a flat tire you have to know to look out for dangerous and posionous things. If you were in a real bad accident you’d have to be prepared just in case they don’t find you in time. You would have to know what nights were like. For example, if it got real cold at night you need to keep youself warm."	1	1		1																					
7238	3	"The desert and the hills had a huge effect on the cyclist. The desert in June must have been very hot and going up those hills had to be hard. The road was also very rough. It says, “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” It also says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The cyclist was very thirsty because of the hot weather. I think the setting had a huge effect on the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
7239	3	"The cyclist’s condition was greatly influenced by his setting because he was lost in the high deserts of California in June. The heat crippiled him or he traveled in search of Yosemite. He became lost and ran out of water making his situation worse. Being lost in seemingly the middle of nowhere in the hot heat he became exausted, dehydrated and fearing heat stroke and loss of consicencess.

The cyclist was traveling to the Yosemite National Park on a hot @DATE1. The cyclist traveled miles after miles on his bike only to past by deserted towns, “This place might have been thriving little spot...a ghost town.” The terrain was threatening because after twenty two miles or so, the cyclist had to overcome, “short rolling hills”, which would use more energy and make his thirst for water even stronger. The cyclist was out of water and the hot day was not helping. After a grueling journey, the cyclist used all the strength he had to go to a local bait shop and drank from the sink after the trechorous environment he was exposed to. The features of the setting in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” were life threatening and almost killed the cyclist, due to lack of water and the terrain he overcome."	1	1		1

7242	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist in the story. In the story, it says, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. I could drop from a heatstroke.“ This statement clearly says that where the cyclist was riding, water was very hard to find and scare. He is talking about how he will die if he doesn’t get water. Another example is that there are no buildings around and is deserted with no one around and many hills and roads. In the story it says, “the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. This means that he was partially all by himself and he had no one to go to."	2	2		2																					
7243	3	"In this story, the features of the setting heavily affect the cyclist. Certain features portray that this “journey” to Yosemite National Park was dreadful, but at the same time enjoyable. ""I would come to along this breeze jaunt."" The word breezy shows that the cyclist can enjoy riding the bike because there is a breeze. Another feature of the setting is very old and dirty. The water that the cyclist is drinking is drying his mouth out even more. “A tar-like substance oozed out followed by brackish water feeling.” This shows the dirtyness of the water. Also this setting shows the cyclist had to use all he had just to survive. It says “working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength.” @CAPS1, the features portray sacrifice and bravely of the cyclist."	2	2		2

The setting around the cyclist led her to drink a lot of water because of the dry conditions. “I was traveling the hish deserts of California in June” This shows that most likely she was hot, sweaty, and a source of water was not near to her. The rough terrain also led to her using own strength to get up and down hills, and to get plants and animals. The settings in the story led the cyclist to become dehydrated and weak, she was forced on as low supply of water and dodge numerous hazards, with no sign of living people near her. “This place might have been a thrivins little spot at one time say, before the last world was"" This suggests a ghost town, where no people were currently living. There was nobody around her to help. The setting led to her deteriorating health. Her physical health was in danger because of her dehydration and her lack of energy.

7245	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist. Because the man didn’t have a lot of water and he was go into the California deserts in June. Another reason is because the flat road was changed into rolling hills and up ahead there was a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” the speed limit was @NUM1. One more thing is make sure you don’t listen to a gentleman that is old and hadn’t be off ther porch in decades. That is some of the things that can affect the cyclist.	1	2		2

In the essay, the author sets up the story describing the day as, “traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Because of the amount of heat the cyclist was enduring, he became weary and dehydrated. Alone with this, the cyclist had to work much harder because the man noticed, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This setting is a major setback to the cyclist’s journy, and required him to persevere. In my life there have been numerous obstacles which I have had to persevere through.

Everything around the cyclist is percieved negatively, so the naturally the cyclist feels like the task is harder and more challenging than it really is. For example, nothing is surrounding the cyclist but sand and the hot temperature since the setting is so empty and no one is around, then everything seems harder than it really is. Also the cyclist feels like he can’t go on and is weak because there is no living he around him.

One feature that affected the cyclist was the snake he encountered on his way, for example in the text it says “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake”, “I cased post, tyring to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” This proves that the snake was a feature that affected the cyclist by giving him a point to stay calm even in the state he was in being dehydrated and all the affects he encountered from that."	1	1		1

For instance, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” @CAPS1, he did not know where he was going so it was harder for him.

In the story the cyclist takes two old men’s advice on the best way to get to Yosemite mountin and gets himself in the middle of nowhere. He finds himself in the California desert without water, he lets this go to his head. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” That line was from the last page of the story. The biker was taking an unfamiliar route and he let himself believe he would die. He knew he was in the desert without water the setting makes him nervous because he was in a desert. He wouldn’t have been nearly as nervous if he was in a forest where there are streams. He lets the desert and the heat convince that he is going to die. By coming across ghost towns he believes he will never see anothe person again, he gets oledrar because of where he is. He thinks the heat will kill him.

The conditions such as hills, and rocky roads can decied a future for a cyclist because if the rocky roads turn you off balance you could fall down a hill and give yourself an injury or possibly die. For example, in the short-story it says, “over one long crippling hill, a building came into view” This shows the conditions in which the cyclist had to deal with. In addition, the weather and amount os water can also decide the future. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” This shows us that if the cyclist gets dehydrated enough he could pass out and no one would find him in the desert. In addition, the heat isn’t helping him out any once he could die without anyone knowing. These reasons show us a cyclist needs to make sure they have enough water and the conditons and weather is right so they don’t make a life-threating choice."	3	2		3

This affected him a lot because the desert is very hot. He could have died from either dehydration or exhaustion. Also, in the desert some animals can be very dangerous on the cyclist journey, he saw a poisonous snake. It was a good thing that he was cautious around the snake because if he wouldn’t have been, he might have gotten bitten and there would be no one around to help him. The desert that he was in. also happened to be desserted and there was no one around to help him with the directions. The worst thing would have to be that he ran out of water.

The second setting he arrived at was “One romshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest muic” he continued moving to the next town, which was @NUM1 away, he came to what he thought was a Welch's Grape juice factory and bootling plant. This tools a toll on his confidence because he said ""I hung my head"" he moved on and had finally arrived at un abandoned buiding called ""@PERSON2 and wilbers’s fish camp.

However, once he notice that everything is not has the men said, he seems to grow a little angry and upset, @CAPS2 like the land seemed to reflect this soon he found himself in a bumby and unpleasant road. The setting also seemed to give the man more obstacles to overcome on adventure” tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the movement in front as me.” The land seemed to be leasing and tormenting him, when he started to figure out that listening to the old men was a mistake.

Then when the cyclist rode upon that old shed and the rusty water pumps he began to feel a little worried because he was running out of water and The Old Timers never mentioned the shed. When the cyclist encountered the rolling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes I believe he began to feel dismayed because he was lost. I believe this because in the text he says ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me dead."" This shows how hopeless the man fealt. when he reached ""Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp"" he was relieved and thankfull because he no longer had death blazing towands him in the form of a yellow sun, empty spaces, and empty water bottle.

First he had to go miles without water which resulted in him loosing faith becoming dehydrated and not continuing with his plans. The terrain he had to go through was unbearable and could almost kill him without water. Luckily he had faith and determined so he got through it and learned a lesion.

First, since he is riding through the desert in June, that means that it is very hoy out and he will need plenty of water for his long bike ride. Also, the terrain of which he is riding is rough which causes him to lose energy. The sun was also beggining to heat down on him which means that he was going to have a hot ride to the town and which later caused his struggle for water. Overall, the hot, desert setting affects the cyclist. It causes him to dehydrate and have a need for water. In the story it says, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips” and that he could drop from a heatstroke on a beautiful day in June, This is basically showing that the hot environment caused him to drink a lot of water, and now he has run low which could cause him to have a heat stroke."	2	2		2

In this story the cyclist had to pass a large snake “a ridiculously large"" snake – it realy didn’t look like a diamondback – blocked a majority of the pavement in front of me “(Kurmaskie).

7294	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he is in the desert and it is very hot outside. Also he is running out of water. This is bad because he could become dehydrated. Another example is when he comes upon the building he thinks it is a mirage at first because he’s pretty much dehydrated. The rough terrain also makes it hard for him to pedal and he is already weak from lack of water.

The heat of the weather and lack of water makes the cyclist develop an uncaring matter. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps…with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” The verbal irony in this passage delivers a negative feeling to the reader and it is here that it is clear that the cyclist doesn’t care what happens to him.

The sun is beating down on him and is making it harder for him to reach his destination. “The sun was begining to beat down...wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.” By him being so hot and tired fromthe sun, he thought that he would die from dehydration.

For example, the cyclist says “sometimes life can feel so cruel.” after he hits rolling hills and a sign warning of rough road and not exceeding the speed limit.

7314	3	"Heat, dessert, humidity – all are things that affect the cyclist as on his journey. First, heat because the heat is making him thirsty for water @CAPS1 he is running row on. For example, the narrator describes, “… water bottles only had a few tantalizing sips.” This means that the day is hot and running out of water. Second, dessert because the narrator is the only one around and deserts are usually diserted. For example the narrator exclaims “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, structure of any kind.” @CAPS1 clearly states that he could be in a dessert where no one wants to be. Lastly, humidity, because it can be hot but then the humidity comes into plan and makes the sky more dry and seen hotter than it usually is. This is why heat, dessert, and humidity all are things that affect the cyclist as he is on a journey."	2	2		2																					
7315	3	"The features of the setting greatly affect this cyclist. At first he is fine riding along the old-timers “shortcut” as he states that “things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” But what he didn’t know was this was the beginning of a very rough day. He arrived at the first “town” which was a ghost town. He wasn’t overly worried yet but at about sixty miles in on his journey he came to a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a broken down corral. The cyclist explains how he had drank a lot of his water and was in need of some. He tried the pumps but he explains how “a far like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” A couple miles later he came to a highway sign that read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The cyclist continued on desperate for water. He even came across a snake. He was now fearing a heat stroke. He came to an abandoned grape juice factory and hung his head. The cyclist then was almost completely dehydrated from the long, tiring bike rid. The cyclist was sure he was going to die from dehydration or a heatstroke that this terrible ride had caused. He finally came to a shop a drank from the sink. So this ride was torturous due to the setting."	3	3		3																					
7316	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in positive and negative ways. At first, there were the two old men who gave the cyclist the out-of-date information. They affected him negatively because if it wasn’t for them, the cyclist would have never gotten lost. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, the water pump affected him, the cyclist was running out of water and the water from the water pump tasted like battery acid and was about @NUM1°. The cyclist was becoming more and more dehydrated and the small, rolling hills didn’t help his dehydration, he also used a lot of energy in order to go over the hills. Finally, he found Gary and Wilber’s fish camp where he was able to get water. This whole experience in a way, affected the cyclist positively even though, at the time, he was affected negatively. The cyclist learned to not take advice from really old people who “haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” The cyclist was affected positively and negatively by the features of the setting."	1	1		1																					
7317	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” the cyclist is on a journey to Yosemite National Park and stops for advice on a quicker route. When he asks the old men he says, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office.” Along with using their advice he faces abandoned ghost towns that they said were thriving spots. The cyclist overcomes the rolling hills of terrain and mirages and the heat of a day in June in the California in deserts. Finally he sees bait and tack shop and when he sees that the men who own the place are older than the other guys he just stares at them in all. Based on the quote you can infer that the cyclist will ignore their advice about having the best map. "	2	2		2

Finally, when you are ready to go to sleep you can’t just pull over you have to ride until you find a hotel or get home. I know that I would not make it. So those are just a few reasons on why the setting affects cyclist."	1	1		1

He says “the growing realie at von that l would drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This means that the heat is a treat to him and would cause him to become dehydrated and have heatstroke. The cyclist is troubled by the scarce sourroundings. ""a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule.” He is getting worried because there is no one around and his directions are starting to sound wrong. The cyclist is relieved by the water from the sink. He had the “overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them.” This means that that he is so relieved that he has finally found water and he wants to thanks the owners of the bait shop for providing it."	3	3		3																					
7320	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie. The downhill land format helped him in a way because he wouldn’t have to use strength and pedal as hard without having as much water in his body. When he came to a pump, it was rusty with tar oozing out followed by hot brackish water flavored like battery acid. The dryness of the dessert had a bad affect on the cyclist because he wasn’t able to get to the Yosemite water until the end. The breeze of the wind had a positive affect because it helped to cool him down.

And how he came over a long, crippling hill he was riding real fast. So unfortunately he was riding fast non stop and how he came through the whole road with relief. He felt so free and how he when he came over hills that are tall and large. But he mostly believed he could find his way at the end. He said it himself he always stuck in the future.

7335	3	"One of the biggest problems that the author faced in his essay was his surroundings. The setting of the story in Yosemite provided many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist. He had to bike many miles, but he only had limited supply of water. Eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed. It is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through. Any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the direction he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time. It was his confusion as to where the next time was that kept him biking, with difficulty and made for an interesting story. An example of the vastness of the park was when he quote, “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’ This place might have been a thriving spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This quote shows that even after many miles, he hadn’t seen a sign of anyone living, which would have increased his desperation to keep looking for civilization."	3	3		3																					
7336	3	"In ''Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the author depicts the vivid details of the setting and how they contribute to the cyclist’s condition. For example, the author wrote “Over one long, crippling hill, a building come into view. I wiped the sweat from my eye” The way the author described the hill as “crippling” should how much energy it was taking away from the cyclist. Another quote that contributed to the cyclist’s journey was, “that smoky blues tune ''Summer time” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain.” This expressed how dehydrated the summer heat way making him. I believe the author used modifying details to support the description of the cyclist’s condition. I think the description of the setting enhanced the reader’s perception of the cyclist’s journey.

For example in the story it said, ”At same point, tumple weed crossed my path.” This is saying that he is in the desert or somewhere very hot because I know that you usually only see tumple weeds in very hot places. Thus, being in the desert affect the cyclist because he is already low on water then being  in a place as hot as the desert made him get even nor dehydrated. Another feature in the setting in this story that affected the cyclest is the hills he had to climb. This affected him because he was already  dehydrated and climbing hills made him have to work more which caused him to lose more sweat and become even more dehydrated.

If you run out of water then you might as well have run out of life. Without water, dehydration kicks in and it affects not only your body, but your mind too. The cyclist only had a limited amount of water with him when he started. ”I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.“ Through the deserted towns he came across, he searched for a source of water but found none that were useable.” When I tried a drop or two ,it had the flower of battery acid.” @CAPS1 feature was the heat. It began to mess with his mind and take toll on his body quickly.” I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage” He worned about heatstroke and his bodys need for water throughout the entire trip. Finally, in the deserts of California, wildlife can affect you.

Later however, his determination was fading as he realized that his “short cut” was not so short after all. The “high deserts of California in June” and the terrain changed furthered his dehydration and need to find water. The emptiness of his surrounding with “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” made him focus on the horizon and tell himself that if he made it there, the he’d be alright. Finally, a building came into view. The hope he got from this gave him strength to move on. Ironically it was an abandoned building. The cyclist describes it as a “Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant.” @CAPS2 this he had lost hope and hung his head. Believing he was going to die, the cyclist got back on his bike. Driving away from the factory, he saw a sight of a fish camp and immediately regained hope. Going there, he regained his strength and learned his lesson, never take road advice from other people.
