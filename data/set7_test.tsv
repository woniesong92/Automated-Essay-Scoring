19222	7	"I am writing about a time when someone I knew was extremely patient. He was having to be patient with one thing: @CAPS1. When I was very young, once at a hotel pool, I had almost drowned. Since then I was afraid to swim. So, my patient friend taught @CAPS1 how to swim at a pool in his trailer park. What he had to be patient about though was getting @CAPS1 into the deep water of the pool. He wanted @CAPS1 to go to the deep end of the pool but I was to afraid I would drown. So then he decided he needed to get @CAPS1 into the deep end somehow. We got out of the pool and walked to the deep end. He just told @CAPS1 to jump in, but he should’ve realized I wouldn’t just jump in. He did eventually get @CAPS1 into the water of the deep end, but all I would do was hang onto the edge and not let go to swim or anything. So after that, I just got out and he began to get a little frustrated. He was patient though, and kept working with @CAPS1. After what seemed like hours, he pretended he was going to give up on @CAPS1. I told him if he stayed, I’d go in the deep end. So he did, and I jumped in and realized it wasn’t so bad after all. So now I love swimming, especially in the deep ends. That’s how my friends hard work and patience payed off for both @CAPS1, and him."	9	8		17				2	2	2	3			2	2	2	2								
19223	7	"It was the @DATE1 and I, @PERSON1, had applied for @ORGANIZATION1. I had applied in @DATE2 and was patiently waiting for a letter addressed to @CAPS1 @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION2. From the beginning of the @DATE1 I had checked the mail box every day.  Every day as I ran down the drive way I hoped that day would be the day the letter would come. I was afraid because @NUM1 of the @DATE1 had passed and still no letter. It was like waiting for that one moment at the climat of the movie when you think the main character will make his move. @CAPS4 was the first @DATE3 in @DATE4 and l was eating lunch. I thought to myself ""@CAPS2 is the day it has to be."" I heard the sound of the mail truck pulling up to our mail bat and botted for the door. As I met the mail lady she smiled, everyday she sees me.  Every day she sees my smile fade as I check the mail for that one letter address to @CAPS1 @PERSON2. She looks at me and says ""@CAPS4 is that day."" Patience is a hard thing to get, but in the @DATE1 I had had my fair share of patience."	8	12		20				2	2	2	2			3	3	3	3

I did try to make it rush by, but it didn’t work. I had been off of school now for @NUM1 weeks and I had did everything I wanted to do. When me my mom, sister and friends go we always have a lot of fun (of corce). Every night since , I have known we are going to cedar point I would sit there and think one day when many kids would ask and complain to there mom saying, “ can’t it come anymore,” but me never, not one I know that no one could make time go by faster. So I waited did my chores, packed and watched tv. Trust me it was very long, very boring and is itching at me to complain but I didn’t. I took a deep breath every time, this would happen to me. And say only a little wait compared to other things. I would also think about how lucky I am to be going to cedar point. I know I am a very impatient person and I am trying to fix it. This is what I try to do and do while waiting for cedar point to come along. This is what patient is to me, and in my life.

I think that I was really patient when I got back from a trip, with my friend to @LOCATION1. I was waiting on the airport for my dad to come and pick me up and I was so exited!you see I had been gone for two weeks and I was really homesick. It took everything I had to not go looking for him, but I knew I couldn’t just go running off I had to be very patient. In the end it was worth it because it would have been harder to find him if I had went looking for him. As you can see, I think I was very patient when waiting for my dad in the airport.

So we got on the dock and there wa a line and I was patient an waited to get on, @CAPS1 there was another line to check your passport, so I was patient and waited. @CAPS1 there was another sticken line. It was to get our room keys, but I was patient and waited again and just stood there for a little bit and it was done, but wait you would never guess, there was another line. So like all the other lines I stood there on my iPod listening to music. They my dad said “ready”, I said ready for what another line he said “no” to look at your “room and relax .“ I was so excited. Finally we where done with the lines no more for a white. So I open my door with my very special key that we had to wait in line for and looked at my room it was amazing.

She answered about @NUM1 seconds afterward ''oh, hi @CAPS2!'' she exclaimed and smiled kindly. ''I have to finish my homework and eat. ''I nodded. So I went to wait in the park. I sat on the swing and swang back and forth. An hour went by. I patiently sat there. I didn't know if she was coming out and decided maybe I should go home. It was getting dark. When I got up she was outside. I told her I had to go home because it was late I could come back tomorrow, through. That was a time I was patient."	11	12		23				3	3	2	3			3	3	3	3

My mom and I went hunting with @PERSON1, my step dad. We had to be quiet so a deer could come. We sat there being quiet. I think it was the quietest I've been ever! All of us were getting sick of being quiet but we had to be in order for a buck could come. It was very cold and l was dressed warm but I was still could. There was a little heater in the shead thing we were in. we couldn't complain being cold or tired. Or just waiting, so we all sat there not complaining that was good. When l was about to ask if we could go in a ten pointer came out of the woods to find something to eat. We were waiting patiently for the doer to come closer. @PERSON1 loaded the gun and pulled the trigger. The buck jumped and ran of. Purted shot! We got out of the shead and searched for a blood trial. We had to wait a while to find the deer but it was wroth it. The right way to be patient, shuting your mouth, not wining and waiting. A good skill to learn is being patient.

When we finally made it to the @ORGANIZATION1 market we had to stand in line for about @NUM3 mins. I told my mum I’m ready to leave but she said I have to be patient and that being inpatient is a bad thing. After we left there we had to take my grandma to the doctors it took them almost two hours just to call her name. then it take another @NUM4 to get checked out. After that we went shopping for some clothes and shoes and the mall was very crowded and busy. We were at the mall for like four hours and most of the time we were standing in lines. Finally, we went home because it was time for my mom to start cooking. I learned that I need to work on being patient because it is a part of life."	9	7		16				2	2	2	3			2	2	1	2

There was one @CAPS2 in life when I was patient. Yay! Yag! My mom is taking my friends and I to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I called many friends, and told them if they wanted to go.  Meanwhile, we packed up some water bottles and hopped into the can. We were all looking out the window. OMG! Look at those big roller coasters. One of my friends shouted out. There we were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2; the first ride I saw was the @CAPS3. The highest and fastest roller coaster there well, it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. So we were all talking about it, then we decided to go on it. Wow! The line is huge. We all said. I shouted out its ok, I heard its an awesome ride lets just all be patient. Meanwhile, we waited and waited, until we were finally the next people to ride. We went on the ride, and then all of a sudden the ride start, we didn’t know and it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. We waited about two hours but it was worth it. In conclusion, I really do think that being patient is a good thing in life, even if it takes hours. I learned so much from just going on the @LOCATION1, we should all be patient because no matter where you are, you will always need to be patient."	8	8		16				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2

19243	7	"Patience in @CAPS1: Understanding and being toterant is what makes up patience. In order to play on any sport team, you have to have patience. I say that because you might not always get the pass or score the point but you are still important to them team, you’re time will come. A time when I was patient was when I was on the @CAPS1 court. It was during our game the carman – @PERSON1 girls @CAPS1 team was going against flushing. A young lady from flushing not fouled (I didn’t even see it, truth be told I’m not even sure if it happen but you can’t argue with the officials) she was shooting her free throws. She was taking forever! I’m surprised her shot wasn’t took. What was she waiting for? New @CAPS2? I didn’t say anything. I just stood nice and patient! Eventually the girl shot (@CAPS3 @CAPS4) she didn’t make either of them. Anyhow, I was so proud of myself ,I felt really happy for myself. I’m just now realizing that, that whole time I was standing there is didn’t a face, or say anything or think something in my head! I was just standing tall for the first minding my own business and untelling to see if it would go in. Then on the second shot (you can now bar out) I just assumed the box out position. Sit down, but down hands out and face the basket. I was really happy for myself and I even told the girl good shot. Hence, it pays off to be patient. One, I got the rebound and my teammate got the point and I also got an assist. Two, I was displaying the right way to act to the opposite!

The whole time I was on the side lines. Never went in not ounce. I was very patient. Not to say I wasn’t mad. At least I got some exercise standing there. The whole time I suported my team mates. I encouraged. I help in any way shape or form. I listend to them complain. But I did give suport. There I was so mad I could have killed. I was ready but my coach said no. It has my time to shine.

19247	7	In my opinion being patient is when your waiting your turn for some thing. And being impatient means not writing your turn. In your whole life you have patientence because sometimes you might just have to wait. I have patience and I know a lot of people who have patience to. I was raised to have patience when your doing something don’t rush because you can mess up. Don’t go way to slow because then people will think you don’t know how to do it. You can just go at your paste so you can get it done right and the way you want to. People who don’t have patience aren’t always happy all the time.	5	8		13				0	1	2	2			2	2	2	2

So I waited and then @DATE2 finally came, more months passed and i still hadn’t heard from my uncle. I began to become fustrated with him because he promised me that phone. I told my mom and she said he has always been like that and to keep my patience so what if he got it a little late. I was thinking in my haad A little it’s been almost a year! Then on @DATE1 my uncle came over for my family reunion.Then he told me he knows that I thought he forgot about the phone. I  knew he was right but just then a little light bulb went off in my head he couldn’t have forgotten about. Soon it was time to eat and that is when he presented the @CAPS2 touch to me. I was so excited I just had to jump up and give a hug. He told me that whenever he promised me something he would test my patience to see if the wait was worth waiting and in this case it was. So whenever your patience is being tested keep your cool it will all come to you soon.

We didn’t have a spare so we drove home on our rim. that is the most patient I have ever been. To @CAPS2 this writing sample she could have explaned what a millennium is. That would make things more clear. Also she could stop useing  I to start most of her sentences. That  would make it more  instening. In the third sentence she put were instead of was. That would make her sound smarter and get a better grade. In the second paragraph I dont know I she ment @TIME1. or @TIME1. If she said if it was a.m. or p.m. It would make the story more clear. If she corrected all those this would be a good sample."	8	8		16				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2

19261	7	"The one time when I was paitent was on the @CAPS1 of last year. Some of the reasons how I was paicent was by keeping to myself or as you know it being quiet. The @CAPS1 is not that hard but when you have to have paitence thats when it gets hard to you, and me. Pacents is key because you will have to use it for a long time! But lets get back on track shall we. On the @CAPS1 when you are done you have to wait for your class mates to be done. So in that spare time you can read a book or check over your work. Pacents is also important because when you taking the @CAPS1 you cant rush on it. You have to take your time and know that you are timed. Thats where pacents comes in! Sometimes when you are done with the @CAPS1 you can just sit there and think about what you did today the reason I say this is because of other people! If everyone in the classroom don’t have pacents you are most likly to fail the @CAPS1. You have to have a silent and quiet room! Now if every body in the room and is being silent than you can and will do good. When I have the @CAPS1 @CAPS8 pacent when I am done because I care about other peoples work habbits with the @CAPS1. I understand that you don’t have the @CAPS1 no more but it is being pacient! When I get my test results back this year in seventh grade I hope I did good because my classmates and I all had pacients!

It also means you can go through tough times without complaining. Every year I’m not that patient, and every year we go to @LOCATION1. We go @LOCATION1 for labor day, to walk the bridge. The rule is, if you don’t  complain you get fudge. I thought I wasn’t gonna get fudge, because I had pulled muscles in both my legs and the night before embers burnt my legs. I knew that to get fudge I had to be patient. So I got dressed, walked to the bridge, and gathered up all my confidence and patience and started the mighty walk. Every year we try and beat our bridge walking time and I thought my legs would slow us down. So I told myself “be patient” over and over and then I sped up going past the first three miles in @NUM1 minutes, (because my legs were worn out). I knew to beat out record we would have to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes. We were walking faster than I thought we could and my legs felt like @CAPS3 were ready to burst! I couldn’t do it anymore. I knew I had to stop and complain, @CAPS1 my legs kept telling me “@CAPS2!” @CAPS3 wouldn’t let me stop, @CAPS3 were: tolerating the pain and being patient. I also had to be patient if I wanted fudge. So I cranked up the speed and sped to the finish line not only to get fudge, @CAPS1 also to beat our record. Thanks to patience I got delicious fudge and we beat our record. That’s a time I’ll never forget, because I had patience and I kept going until I crossed the finish line. That’s how I was patient, and I’m glad I was patient with my legs. I’m not very patient so thank goodness for patience!"	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

I asked “@CAPS1 did you get @CAPS5 good at putting make-up?” @CAPS2 responded “with patience and years of practice.” The next day when I had gotten an allowance, I asked my mom “@CAPS3 mom, can we go to @ORGANIZATION1, later?” @CAPS2 replies “@CAPS4, @CAPS9?” I answered “@CAPS5 I can get some make-up to practice with”. “@CAPS6.” @CAPS2 says.

After @CAPS6 finished our game, @CAPS4 continued to make small talk, and then checked her list to make sure @CAPS6 had everything while I played a game on her phone.

Of course, once we got there we still had to go on lots of other rides. We usually start at the front and work hack, doing things in order. This I didn’t mind since we went on mostly big rollar coasters with a few acceptions for rides like @PERSON2 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and @ORGANIZATION1. My mind was kept plenty distracted from the maverick with how mad, fun I was having at the time. Unfortunately, it became harder to keep my patience once we got to the @CAPS5 since  the line was nearly an hour and a half long.

19283	7	Once I knew a girl whos name was @ORGANIZATION1 and met another girl named @PERSON1. They had been inseperable until high school. @ORGANIZATION1 had gotten many more friends and started becoming very popular. @PERSON1 called @ORGANIZATION1 everyday to see how she was and or if she wanted to hangout. @ORGANIZATION1 kept lieing to @PERSON1 saying she was busy and always said lies and blowing her off. But one day @ORGANIZATION1 had a very bad day and when she tried to tell her new friends about it and apologized how she was acting. @ORGANIZATION1 had learned that @PERSON1 really was a true friend and was patient with @ORGANIZATION1 through the bad times. This shows that if you are truly patient only good thing can come.	8	10		18				2	2	2	2			2	3	2	3

19302	7	Patience is when you can wait a while without complaining or giving up about waiting and that patient. An example of being patienc is lets say your standing in line for @NUM1 hours to get tickets to see your favorite band play. Now waiting @NUM1 hours in line is being patient to get the tickets. While out complaing or anything. Being patient is very respectful to yourself and others around you. But I also think that everyone could use a little patience. I think that people should think about patience more often. If everyone in the world didnt have patience the world would be a crazy mess. Example: @CAPS1 one would be waiting these too. Everyone would waiting be first. It could just be crazy. So I’m happy that there is patience in this world and people have it.	7	4		11				0	2	2	3			0	1	1	2

For example, I had to give my mom @NUM1, but I did not have the @NUM1 write then and there my mom did not complain she waited she had patience. Patience does not mean you keep beging. It means that you are understanding and tolerant. If your dad said he is going to give you some pizza, have patience and wait on that pizza. When you have patience people will have patience with you. For example if you was waching tv and you did not want to get up yet people will have patience and wait for you to get up. Patience does   not mean you keep asking. For example I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 beging my mom for candy not knowing if I had patience a waited on her answer I would get the candy, but I didn't.

One example of this might be if someone else is fixing something for you and you really waited them to be finished so you can move on with your life, but it is the type of thing that takes time, maybe a lot of time, but if you want it done right, you will have to wait. Sometimes it will not be a person you wait for, but an inamate object, like a television show, which can not be rushed, even though sometimes you want to ruch it. With a human however, if you rush them to do something, (which can happen it @MONTH1 end up being not as good and even breaking in about ten seconds after them doing it, it @MONTH1 end up happening faster though. You might also waight for nature too, such as a sunny day. When it @MONTH1 have been raining for over a week. You also might be waiting for the power to come back on during storm.

Br the end up the weak we had ten pages wrting written down.i went on my acer and type  th e ten page paper. After all the spell checks and grammar checks we printed our story and turned it in. The results came at the end of the day it was tie between @CAPS2 and @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 and me. So our writing was given to the state for another compition I ronaly @PERSON2 pair and my pair won again! I really hope we don't tie for the country competition. So here I was on the stage still staring at the audience all done thinking about how I got here. I was so tired of waiting. @CAPS1 told me to have some patient so I did. After twenty minutes of judging the presdent came up and said @PERSON3 and @CAPS1 have won first place. We jumped up and down and got on trophy. @CAPS1 and we found at that hard work and patience can really lead to something great.	10	12		22				2	3	2	3			3	3	3	3

As much as I just wanted to go to the front of the line and get the tickets, I didn’t because that would berude. I felt that helped me develop my patients a little bit more.

When we turned @CAPS1 in the lady said we had a back side too. After the paper work we had to wait another week because they had  to fix him. My mom went shopping for dog store they told us we could pick him up on @DATE2. We were so excited. Instead of @DATE2 we thought we could pick him up on @DATE1. On that @DATE1 we picked him up @CAPS1 took @NUM2 years of patience for my sister and only @NUM3 years for me. A year later we went back to adopt or just look for another dog.We didn’t find one, but we waited and if your patient you will get something for that.

I need to, until   they are alone helping someone else. In   any of my classes I am patient most of the time. In art class we were making a box out of clay and I was behind a little because, I had in finish my project that was due the week before, so when I had started working on my box, I did as much as I could remeber from the art teacher’s demonstration. That was the start of it. So when I needed help I asked a friend that was done if they would help me get caught up, they said, yes, so I was getting help from them. When someone else asked for help. So she helped when. I wailed, it took about the whole hour but, I wailed and was patient with them. At the end   of the hour they still waent done so she said she would help me the next few days. I said alright and then I said, I’d see them the next day. The next day in art @PERSON1 helped me and when she took a break or worked on her own thing, I tried my best and waited patiently for her to help me again. @PERSON1 was almost done with her present but, I was still waiting, so I asked someone else until she was finished with her project. Finally, when she was finished she helped me with the rest of my boy. At the end of the hour I finished with it. Then we started a new project the next day that was simple. That’s not the only time but, it’s the most longest time I was patient with some one."	10	8		18				3	3	2	2			2	2	2	2

I will turn and most likely buy candys. My parents try to take my money and hide it so I can’t spend it but I always end up finding it and spending it because it don’t want to and until they give it back most the time that happened. I get grounded but item worth it because I get candy.

I got my shots which took a very long time, I was frustrated, I got my shots, before we left they told me that I would be coming back for more shots. I was still hungry so we got @CAPS2.Donalds.

I was overjoyed to be going to a water park on my birthday. I wanted to party and get my swim on but it was almost @NUM1 weeks away. I didn’t want to wait any longer, but I knew that being patient would make my experience even better. I was tolerant, understanding, and patient. The week dragged on.

When the thought of me going to the water park got stuck in my brain like glue, the problem was clear. If I didn’t think about it, time would fly by again.

All of a sudden I saw a bunch of teenagers just cut in front of the little girl. She was so patient she just stood their standing behind the teenagers that cut in front of her. The line got longer in just a few minutes. I left to go on some rides and when I came back the poor little girl was still there. More and more people had cut in front of her but she didn't say anything. All she did was mumble to herself. I couldnt stand it! I wondered how she could just let them cut like that. If I was that little girl I would of lost my patience a @CAPS1 @CAPS1 time ago. I was so amazed with how much patience she had. She finally got up to the front of the line and @CAPS3! Out came the closed sign. I couldnt believe my eyes she didnt even get mad. I kept watching until the end. She finally walked over to the @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS4 stand and did the same exact thing!

Waiting your turn is being patience one time I was patient by waiting on the bench to play but I didn`t get to play until the fourth queiter with @NUM1 to go but you know what I did had patience. A lot of people have patient but some people just don`t have manner when they just don`t care and start the yell and screaming. Like popstars a lot of singers popstar and other famous people think they can cut in front of any one cause their rich but it they wern`t rich they would cut pop stars and movie stars just need to have patient. Am not saying all popstars and movie stars don`t have patient when they were little they never act like that.	8	4		12				2	2	2	2			0	1	1	2

19395	7	"Patience is the ability to be tolerant,understanding and face difficulties without complaining. Patience isn’t  something they teach you in my school. There isn’t a book your assigned to read called  patience @NUM1,there is no movie called patience is the key. Non of that exists, even if you live in a world where a necklace can be turned into a camera, or a cell phone is a gun. I have just been assigned my first undercover mission and it’s not at all wat  i had expected. So far, all I have done is sat on a cold bench next to  the strength meter at a county fair. What people really don’t understand is the patience that is put in to being a spy. Sure theres an ocasional car being blown up bet  not today, not for me. I here the clock in my hand so ‘tick,tock,tick,tock’. @CAPS3  @CAPS2, there’s come action. The subject (the person I’m assigned to watch is on the move and, oh, nevermind, all the subject has done is bay a three dollar bag of popcorn. I start to doodlle a design in the dirt, with my foot. I’m just about to abort the mission. Seeing that nothing is happening when all of a sudden I find a clue. There in the dirt that lay just before me. I see a tiny computer chip. I pick it up and spray it with finger print revealing mist. A purple fluffy cloud of vapor sorround the chip. Sure enough when the purple cloud vanishes. I see that the subjects fingerprints are on the chip, I pull out my laptop at insert the computer chip. @CAPS1 @CAPS1 are the words that stay on the computer screen as if refusing to leave. I sit there waiting bored. I remember patience. I think to myself that if I’m able to defeat twelve armed robers with nothing but a tablecloth, I’m sure I can sit here and just be patient.  At least twenty minutes have gone by now but i feels like twenty hours. The computer still has written on the screen, @CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1 wassucsessful. “@CAPS2!” I say aloud and people start to stare, but I dont mind. I click the square on the screen that says “open.” @CAPS3 a small message opens up that says “@CAPS4 me at the ice cream pallor.” I close my laptop and start to slowly walk over to the ice cream van, observing everyone , and everything around me. A man wearing a yellow shirt and a lady with a purple scarf diaped over her head are the only two people standing by the icecream stand. I walk a little bit closer and i realise that the man has a gun. I pull out mine and with a few loud roars they were both in handcaffs ofcoure, they were both working with the main suspect. I would have never been able to sucsesfully complete  my mission without being  patient."	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

I told her to be patient and it would fill like time is going faster .She said, she is going to try, but if it didn’t work were leaving. She waited patiently and next thing you know the doctor came back in the room and said thanks for being patient. He was still looking for the needle then he came back in the room and said I found it. It was in the other doctor  room above the sink on the dresser, after  I got my shot the doctor thanked me and my mom for being patient and not leaving. after he thanked me he gave me he gave me a sucker and shook my hand.

I asked why he was doing that and I thought their response  was hilarious. They said he was trying to be like @CAPS6 and fly to the top. At the end of the three day field trip, my patience grew to the size of a spider monkey. And every time my patience would grow to the size of a drop of water, the spider monkey in my head would be trying to find a way out so they could knock the idiot out. I learned to have patience with someone, even if they were being a idiot and not moving fast enough, I would stay calm and make sure to not let the spider monkey hit somebody where it hurts most."	10	12		22				3	2	2	3			3	3	3	3

We finally could see the @CAPS2 coaster, I guess at that point it looked like time flew by, mabey because we were excited. We finally were on the ride, one of the funest rides in the whole park called “The mauerie”. I guess the wait was worth it. The ride went about @NUM3 per hr, it was jerky, there were drops, it was fun. We were a little patient, but did we enough patients to get back on, I don’t think so."	10	11		21				3	3	2	2			3	3	3	2

Be patient with what even your doing just be patience even if its waiting run school to be even. If your waiting for a same at stem to come sat have patience a wait because it might keep you out of trouble.

19470	7	"There are two reasons why I think patience is important. The first is because if you are not patient, than you can end up distracting other people around you. For example, if you finished your @CAPS1 test early and you kept telling everyone else to burry up it’s distracting. Now that you’ve interrupted everyone, they have lost their train of thought and now they @MONTH1 have to start over. A few weeks ago, my sister and I were out walking my dog and pulled so hard my little sister fell over and my dog ran away. We had to be patient and wait for him to return.  My sister kept wanting to go call my mom to tell her the dog ran away again but I told her it would be rude to call because it would distract her from her work. Another reason why patience is important is because if you are not patient can get hurt. Let’s say you were going down the stairs and your sibling was in front of you and you needed to get downstairs quickly but they were walking down the stairs very slow, so you pushed them, they could get very hurt. In conclusion, patience is needed always and cannot be forgotten"	9	6		15				2	2	2	3			1	1	2	2

19502	7	"Being patient is waiting quietly for something to happen. A lot of times, you have to patient for a lot of things, such as long lectures, birthdays, and orchestra concerts. Sometimes, no matter how patient you are, the thing you have been waiting for does not happen, and you’d have to leave without doing what you wanted to do for the whole time (and that has happened many times with me). For long lectures, sometimes you have the urge to leave. You have to be patient and wait for the lecture to end. For birthdays, you really want to eat the cake. But, yes, you do have to wait until your annoying sister finishes blowing out the candles and makes her wish. I am part of the orchestra, and we have a orchestra @ORGANIZATION1 about every two months. The first @ORGANIZATION1 is an open @ORGANIZATION1, and they are usually in @NUM1. Last year it was the @NUM2. At the end of the @ORGANIZATION1, there is a cheese cake sampling station, and cookies, and domus, and all these good cake. But first, I must suffer through playing through many pieces, watch the beginners play and watching at honid video ??? videotapes my face, waiting for a mistake so any annoying can laugh at it and call me an “epicfail”. But I still live. Playing the piece isn’t so bad, it’s just some pieces of paper with notes and watching the beginners might is torture, but at least I don’t have to play. Video @CAPS1? No pain at all.  Who says I’m going to mess up? All I have to do is to sit in the back row, and my mom might not even see me. My sisters might not even care. And then soon comes the cheese cake, at like @NUM3 at night. That is the good part, but to get to the good part, I must be patient. I’m not really looking forward to this year’s @ORGANIZATION1, on @DATE1, because on that day I have a final cross-country meet after school. Where all five middle schools come together for a big district meet at a place called @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION2. After that meet, my parents have to bring me to that @ORGANIZATION1 at the high school at @TIME1. The @ORGANIZATION1 closes down at @NUM4, like always, and I am hoping I’m not going to get any homework. But if I do, I’ll just have to be patient. That day is like any old day. @NUM5. I’ll have to wait until school ends, the meet ends, and the @ORGANIZATION1 ends to go home, but I can live. All that is on my mind is to live the whole school year, patiently, without messing up or failing badly."	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

It was the next day already and I still couldn’t wait. During the long ride I fell asleep when I had woke up, we were already there.

A couple years ago, I was picked up from school. My mom was supposed to take me home, but she wanted to go grocery shopping first. When we were there, she asked if I wanted to come in. thinking about all of the reasons why I don’t, of course I said no. I sat in the car when it was at least @NUM1 @CAPS1 outside. I was sweating within ten minutes waiting in the vehicle. My mom still wasn’t out of the store. There was so many times where I wanted to be angry, but I didn’t let myself get this way. I even saw people come in and then come out before my mom got out of the store. It was at least two hours before my mom had finally come out, I wasn’t mad at her, I just understood her reasons and apologies why she was late. Most of the time I am not a patience person.

But there is two ways you could take; a five minute hike straight to lake @LOCATION1, or an hour to two hour hike through the woods and over logs. And on days when I have @CAPS1 patience at @CAPS2, and just want to get straight to lake @LOCATION1 we always have to go the long way around!

Finally, they adopted her and named her @PERSON1. They went through more paper work, said that they would always take care of her, and then went home. After that, @PERSON1 didn’t sleep at all the first week or so. Since @LOCATION3 is @NUM2 hours ahead of @LOCATION2.

Besides, you @CAPS21 you wanted to be a babysitter! Why not try and help at the @CAPS16?” @CAPS2 used her well practiced glare at her mother that @CAPS21 “@CAPS7 if!”. This conversation had been held two weeks ago in the kitchen of the fullers. @CAPS12, @CAPS2’s mother, @PERSON1, was taking her to @CAPS9 county’s only day care, @CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. The name made @CAPS2 want to gag. “@CAPS12 remember sweetie, be nice and try to help out a bit. I love you!” @CAPS13 called @CAPS7 @CAPS13 started to pull out of the driveway. @CAPS2 turned to face the small building. The sign above the building stated “@CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. A friendly and loving environment” @CAPS13 had that gagging feeling again. @CAPS13 turned back to see if @CAPS13 could spot her mother’s red, battered, @LOCATION1 speeding down the poorly paved road. @CAPS4 all @CAPS13 saw was a trail of dust. Great, @CAPS13 thought @CAPS7 @CAPS13 entered through the double doors that had a picture of a big, grinning, clown, “@CAPS12, why don’t you play with little @PERSON4?” @PERSON2 @CAPS21, comforting “little” @PERSON4 in her arms, actually, @PERSON4 was seven, which @CAPS2 thought was a big enough age to not cry when someone yells at them when they’ve asked to play “one” for the billionth time. “@CAPS2 we need to talk.” @CAPS21 the middle aged woman, shunning @PERSON4 to the side,” honey, you’ve got to understand that kids need patience and love. Heck, I remember you @CAPS7 a kid! Boy were you an attention hog!” @CAPS2 looked like @CAPS13 regretted yelling. @CAPS13 smiled and went to find @PERSON4. Maybe he’d still be game for you."	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3
